- Plans for network evolution to offer speeds up to 10 by 1 gigabit per second and fiber on demand by 2026 highlight a long-term strategy for growth and market competitiveness.
- The discontinuation of the ACP could have short-term impacts on customer growth and ARPU, but strategies are in place to mitigate these effects.
- Video business remains under pressure but is evolving with the integration of direct-to-consumer services and modern user experiences to provide value and choice to customers.
