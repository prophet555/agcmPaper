Lithia Motors Q1 2024 earnings call:

Earnings Results:
• Revenue grew 23% YoY to $8.6 billion
• Adjusted diluted EPS decreased 28% YoY to $6.11
• Same-store sales revenues down 2%, gross profits declined 7%
• New vehicle GPU down $1,640 or 22% YoY

• Targeting 50-60% of capital allocation to acquisitions, 15-25% to shareholder returns
• Expect annual acquired revenues of $2-4 billion per year
• Aiming for mid-50% SG&A as percentage of gross profit long-term with adjacencies
• Financing operations expected to break even in 2024
• Pathway to $100 billion revenue generating $2 EPS per $1 billion revenue

Key Themes and Trends:
Lithia Motors delivered solid revenue growth in Q1 despite headwinds from declining new vehicle margins and below normal used margins early in the quarter. The company is focused on operational execution, growing adjacencies, and making strategic acquisitions to drive long-term performance. 

The addition of UK-based Pendragon is impacting consolidated margins and SG&A in the near-term, but provides geographic expansion and diversification benefits. Management sees opportunities to optimize the UK business over time.

Adjacencies like Driveway Finance are maturing and approaching profitability, which will provide incremental earnings growth. Digital initiatives are gaining traction with 32% YoY growth in transactions.

While GPUs are normalizing, Lithia believes its unique and expansive mobility ecosystem across vehicle sales, financing, fleet management and digital channels positions it well to gain share, expand margins and generate strong free cash flows to fund growth and shareholder returns over the long-term. The company reiterated its targets of $100 billion in revenue generating $2 in EPS per $1 billion of revenue.
