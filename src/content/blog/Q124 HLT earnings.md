Hilton reported strong Q1 results that exceeded expectations, demonstrating the resilience of their business model. RevPAR growth of 2% was at the low end of guidance, impacted by renovations, weather, and holiday shifts. However, adjusted EBITDA and EPS meaningfully beat the high end of guidance. Management struck an optimistic tone, expecting continued recovery across segments, especially in group and business transient. Leisure transient demand is normalizing but expected to remain relatively strong.

Development momentum is building, with a record pipeline of 472,000 rooms. Hilton is expanding into lifestyle and luxury segments through partnerships and tuck-in acquisitions like Sydell Group's NoMad brand, Graduate Hotels, and AutoCamp. These moves enhance Hilton's network effect and growth prospects in attractive markets. 

The company maintained its full year RevPAR growth outlook of 2-4%, assuming the broader economy remains resilient with a soft landing. Hilton expects to return $3 billion to shareholders in 2024 through buybacks and dividends.
