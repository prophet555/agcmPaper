Kimberly-Clark reported strong Q1 2024 results, with better-than-expected volume growth despite retail inventory reductions. The company saw improved market share in North America and double-digit volume growth in China. Productivity savings of $120 million in Q1 put Kimberly-Clark on track to achieve its $3 billion target over the next 5 years.

Despite the strong start to the year, management is maintaining its full-year guidance due to uncertainties in the geopolitical situation and input cost environment. The company expects commodity inflation of around $250 million for the full year. Kimberly-Clark plans to further increase investments, with advertising spend set to rise 50 basis points for the remainder of the year.

The company also announced plans to exit some private label businesses by the end of 2025, reducing its exposure from 4% to 2% of global sales. This move will allow Kimberly-Clark to focus its technology investments on strategic priorities. Additionally, the company's new operating model is set to go live on October 1, 2024, with $200 million in SG&A savings expected in 2025 and 2026.

Overall, management expressed confidence in the company's performance and strategy, with CEO Mike Hsu stating, "We are making the company better, stronger and faster. I'm very, very proud of our progress to date, and I'm confident that we're going to continue to leverage our core strengths to achieve our potential."
