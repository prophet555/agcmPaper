Earnings Results:

Hasbro reported Q1 2024 results that demonstrated early progress in its turnaround strategy. While revenue declined, this was largely expected and the company saw strength in its digital licensing and MAGIC: THE GATHERING businesses. Margins significantly improved, driven by cost savings initiatives, supply chain productivity gains, and favorable business mix.

The company is cautiously optimistic about the rest of the year. Consumer Products saw POS momentum late in Q1 that has continued into April, though headwinds remain from reduced closeout sales and a light entertainment slate compared to 2023. Hasbro is seeing positive impact from shifting more marketing spend to digital and improving marketing effectiveness. The Wizards segment is expected to have a solid Q2 with key MAGIC releases.

Overall, Hasbro reiterated its full-year guidance, preferring to monitor progress further before making any upward revisions despite the strong Q1 margin performance. The company is focused on executing its Blueprint 2.0 strategy by driving profitable growth in games and digital licensing, improving the financial profile of Consumer Products through cost savings and product innovation, and investing in key brands and entertainment initiatives.
