Otis delivered solid first quarter results, demonstrating the continued strength of its service-driven business model. Despite challenging new equipment market conditions, especially in China, Otis achieved mid-single-digit organic sales growth driven by its Service business. Adjusted operating margins expanded, with both Service and New Equipment margins improving. The company repurchased shares and announced a significant dividend increase, emphasizing its commitment to delivering shareholder value.

Looking ahead, Otis raised its adjusted operating profit and EPS outlook for the full year. It expects to generate strong free cash flow of $1.6 billion and is increasing its share repurchase target to $1 billion. The company is also acquiring full ownership of Nippon Otis in Japan. 

While new equipment markets remain soft, Otis continues to see strength in its Service business. Maintenance portfolio growth remains above 4% and the Modernization business is expanding rapidly with strong order and backlog growth. However, market conditions in China remain very competitive with ongoing pricing pressure.

Overall, the tone from management was positive, highlighting Otis' resilient business model, operational execution, and cash generation capabilities. They remain confident in their ability to navigate near-term headwinds while investing for long-term growth, especially in the Service business.
