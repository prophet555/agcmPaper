Sentiment:
The tone of the call was quite optimistic. Management struck a bullish tone on the outlook for investment banking and capital markets activity, expecting a sustained multi-year upcycle after a few slow years. While acknowledging some macro/geopolitical risks, they see the strength of the U.S. economy, high corporate cash levels and the need for business model transformation driving robust deal-making. 

Wealth management momentum also contributes to the positive sentiment, with record revenues and strong flows indicating the value proposition is resonating with clients. The continued focus on efficiency and financial discipline enables investing for growth from a position of strength.
