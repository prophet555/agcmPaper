• Adjusted operating income grew 11% and adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 32%
• Adjusted EPS increased 14% to $2.89

• Outlook assumes current macro conditions persist, but meaningful uncertainty remains

Marsh McLennan delivered strong first quarter 2024 results, with 9% underlying revenue growth across all businesses, building on the momentum from the previous year. The company saw an 11% increase in adjusted operating income and an 80 basis point expansion in adjusted operating margin to 32%. Adjusted EPS grew 14% to $2.89. The strong performance was driven by solid demand for the company's services amid a complex risk environment characterized by geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty, elevated inflation and interest rates, and rising healthcare costs.

The insurance and reinsurance markets remained stable, with increased client demand and adequate capacity. Marsh McLennan continued to make strategic investments in talent, capabilities, and acquisitions to strengthen its market position and sustain long-term growth. The company also emphasized its commitment to generating exceptional financial performance while having a positive impact on communities through its ESG efforts.

Looking ahead, Marsh McLennan expects mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, margin expansion (particularly in the second half), and strong adjusted EPS growth for the full year 2024. However, the company acknowledges that meaningful uncertainty remains, and the economic backdrop could differ from its assumptions.
