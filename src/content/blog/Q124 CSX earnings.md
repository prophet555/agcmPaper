The Q1 2024 earnings call for CSX Corporation highlighted solid results that were in line with expectations, despite challenges such as severe weather and the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore. The company saw 3% total volume growth, with strong support from the intermodal business which grew at 7%. While revenue and earnings were lower year-over-year, they showed sequential improvements from Q4. 

The company remains focused on providing strong customer service while controlling costs and running the network more efficiently. Efforts are being made to elevate safety culture and proactively identify risks. CSX is working to mitigate the impact of the Baltimore bridge collapse and has diverted some export coal volumes to other outlets. The estimated net revenue impact is $25-30 million per month.

Underlying demand remains solid across many markets, and CSX sees opportunities from contract renewals, truck conversions, and the ramp-up of industrial development projects. The pipeline for these projects is diverse and implies meaningful acceleration in activity going forward. Intermodal saw very strong growth, especially in the international business, and CSX remains optimistic about domestic intermodal as truck capacity normalizes.

Overall, CSX is confident in its ability to deliver strong incremental performance in the second half of the year. The company is focused on execution, prioritizing customers, and achieving good results.
