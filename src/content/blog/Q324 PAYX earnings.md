The company saw strong client retention, good product penetration, and higher revenue per client. PEO also performed well with continued momentum in worksite employee growth and strong insurance attachment. 

The company is seeing some moderation in employment trends among small businesses but overall macro conditions remain relatively stable. Hiring challenges persist for Paychex's clients, especially in finding qualified candidates. However, the company isn't seeing broad-based layoffs or recessionary indicators.

Paychex provided a preliminary FY24 outlook, expecting 8-9% revenue growth and margin expansion despite a 2% ERTC headwind. The company remains focused on driving profitable growth through investments in technology, digital capabilities, and AI. Management believes Paychex is well-positioned entering the post-pandemic era as a more digitally enabled, agile company delivering more value to clients.
