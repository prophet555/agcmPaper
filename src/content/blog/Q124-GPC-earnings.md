In the first quarter of 2024, Genuine Parts Company delivered results that exceeded expectations, with slight sales growth, improved margins, and mid-single-digit adjusted EPS growth compared to the strong performance in Q1 2023. The company's business mix and geographic diversity provided a positive backdrop despite challenges in the macroeconomic environment, such as higher interest rates and cost inflation.

The Global Industrial segment saw a slight sales decline but delivered exceptional profit conversion, benefiting from supply chain initiatives, enhanced data analytics, and strong expense discipline. The Global Automotive segment posted positive sales growth, with strong performances in Europe and Australasia. The U.S. Automotive business demonstrated solid sequential improvement driven by decisive actions taken in previous quarters.

Looking ahead, GPC remains confident in its ability to drive results, supported by industry fundamentals and the execution of strategic initiatives. The company raised its adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2024 and reaffirmed its sales guidance, expecting stronger growth in the second half of the year. GPC continues to focus on its five key priorities: talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain, and emerging technology, complemented by disciplined acquisitions.
