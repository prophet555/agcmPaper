The Q1 2024 earnings call highlighted SLB's strong start to the year, with revenue and EBITDA growth in line with full year ambitions. The company is benefiting from the breadth, resilience and longevity of the current upcycle, driven by strong energy fundamentals, growing demand and a focus on energy security. This is particularly evident in the Middle East and global offshore markets where SLB has a strong position. 

While North America activity remained soft, international growth was broad-based across regions. SLB is seeing opportunities as customers prioritize efficiency, lower costs, faster time-to-production, and lower carbon solutions. The company is innovating through integration, fit-for-basin technologies and digital to unlock value.

Looking ahead, SLB remains confident in its full year guidance, anticipating the continuation of strong international momentum, especially in Middle East, Asia and offshore. It also expects growth in the production and recovery market as operators focus on maximizing asset value. For Q2, SLB guided to solid sequential growth and margin expansion.
