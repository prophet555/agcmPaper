Equifax delivered strong results in Q1 2024, exceeding expectations on both the top and bottom line despite ongoing weakness in the U.S. mortgage market. The company saw broad-based strength across its business units, with notable outperformance in Workforce Solutions driven by robust growth in government and talent solutions. USIS also performed well, with non-mortgage verticals like banking, auto, telco and consumer credit showing resilience.

Looking ahead, Equifax maintained its full year guidance and expressed confidence in delivering results at the high end or above the previously provided ranges. The mortgage market is expected to remain subdued, with inquiries forecast to be down 20% in 2023. However, the company believes its non-mortgage businesses will continue to grow above the long-term framework of 6-8%.

Equifax also highlighted its progress towards completing its cloud transformation by the end of 2023. This milestone is expected to drive increased innovation, product rollouts and margin expansion in the years ahead. The company is leveraging its cloud capabilities, along with differentiated data, AI and ML investments to introduce new products and drive growth.

While there are some signs of weakness in the broader economy, such as slower hiring in blue-collar roles and softness in marketing spend from some financial institutions, overall sentiment remains positive. Equifax is seeing resiliency in consumer credit quality and expects its non-mortgage verticals to continue performing well.
