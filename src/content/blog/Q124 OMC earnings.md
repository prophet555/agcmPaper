description: Earnings summary for Q124 Omnicom
---
Earnings Results:
- Organic growth was 4% in Q1 2024, with strong performance in advertising/media and precision marketing. 
- EBITDA margin was 13.8% and operating margin was 13.2%.
- Non-GAAP adjusted EPS (excluding amortization) increased 3.7% year-over-year to $1.67.

Future Guidance:
- Omnicom raised its full-year 2024 organic growth guidance range from 3.5-5% to 4-5% based on the strong Q1 results. 
- EBITDA margin for full-year 2024 is expected to be roughly flat with 2023's adjusted margin of 15.6%.
- The integration of Flywheel acquisition is going well and its margins are expected to reach Omnicom's average by Q4 2024.

Key Themes and Trends:
- The integration of Flywheel's retail commerce cloud platform with Omnicom's Omni marketing insights platform creates a powerful end-to-end offering for clients. 
- Precision marketing, which includes Flywheel, is expected to deliver low double-digit growth going forward as e-commerce rapidly expands.
- Omnicom is investing in AI capabilities, integrating them into Omni to enhance creative development, audience targeting and media buying. Management sees AI as empowering its talent rather than displacing it.
- Areas of secular growth and investment for Omnicom include digital transformation consulting, MarTech, and content production.

Market Conditions and Sentiment:
- Management struck an optimistic tone, expressing confidence in Omnicom's market position, differentiated offerings, and talented teams to drive growth. 
- While macro risks and uncertainty remain, Omnicom has strong tailwinds from digital transformation, retail media, AI adoption and new business wins.
- The increased guidance and commentary point to a favorable outlook, with Omnicom well-positioned to gain share in a dynamic but growing market for marketing services and technology.

Overall, the sentiment from Omnicom's executives was positive, highlighting the company's strategic moves (e.g. Flywheel), investments in high-growth capabilities, and improving growth trajectory, while acknowledging the uncertain macro environment. The increased guidance and multiple growth drivers discussed suggest management has increasing confidence in Omnicom's competitive position and financial outlook.
