- The company is outpacing market trends. 

## Cost Optimization and BOM Improvements

### Question

- Can you provide examples of the improvement in BOM costs and who you are benchmarking for the BOM cost for the Gravity? 

### Answer

- Despite pricing actions, gross margin improved due to cost optimization initiatives, including BOM cost reduction. 
- Efforts include working with suppliers and internally on technology and logistics to bring down battery and overall costs. 
- The company is also managing inventory effectively to reduce costs. 

## Escape Velocity and Funding for Future Growth

### Question

- Do you agree with the comparison to Tesla's Model 3 launch and reaching escape velocity with the Gravity? Will you have the funding to reach that point? 

### Answer

- The vision is to achieve significant volume, and the Gravity will play a crucial role in that, capturing a larger market than the Model X. 
- The company's partnership with the PIF provides strong support and mutual incentives for success. 

## Production and Delivery Balancing

### Question

- Could deliveries exceed the 9,000 Airs produced this year, as they have in the past quarter? 

### Answer

- The company has not provided guidance on delivery numbers exceeding production but emphasizes prudent steps to balance production with deliveries to avoid excessive inventory and tie-up of working capital. 

## Supplier Readiness and Gravity Launch

### Question

- Can you provide an update on supplier readiness for the Gravity launch and how you are feeling about it? 

### Answer

- Progress towards Gravity's start of production is closely monitored, with a focus on syncing readiness of the product, factory, and supply base. 
- The company has commissioned a video series to provide transparency on the path to Gravity, highlighting these key pillars. 
- Unlike the Air launch during the pandemic, there will be more opportunities for supplier quality awareness and audit. 

## Gross Margin Trends and Variable Margins

### Question

- Can you discuss trends in variable margins, excluding labor and overhead costs? 

### Answer

- The company has been actively working on cost reduction, including BOM costs, and is continuously bringing down costs through technology and logistics optimization. 
- With Gravity's production approaching, the company expects further improvements in variable and fixed costs due to increased scale and operating leverage. 

## Deliveries to Saudi Arabia and Funding Sources

### Question

- Can you quantify the possible development of deliveries to Saudi Arabia and the agreement's progression? What are the potential funding sources for the next capital raise? 

### Answer

- The company delivered over 500 units to Saudi Arabia in Q1 and sees strong demand in the region, particularly for the SUV. 
- While not providing specific guidance on future splits, the company is confident in the market potential in Saudi Arabia. 
- Lucid will take an opportunistic view of raising capital when needed, acknowledging the strong support from the PIF but not specifying the source of future funding. 

## Impact of Vertical Integration on Margins

### Question

- Will the increased vertical integration through Phase II expansion of AMP-1 lead to increased losses in the near term, and will it decrease variable margins for Air and Gravity? 

### Answer

- While Phase II activities and Gravity component purchases may impact gross margins in the second half of the year, the company expects significant improvements in margins as it scales and reaches its capacity. 
- The company is focusing on improving contribution margins trim by trim and expects better margins with scale due to the amortization of fixed costs by suppliers. 

## Underlying Cost Trends and Pricing Actions

### Question

- Can you comment on the 5% sequential increase in underlying costs per unit delivered in Q1, excluding the impairment charge, and the impact of pricing actions and cost reduction activities? 

### Answer

- The sequential increase is partly due to pricing actions taken in the current quarter, which were largely offset by cost reduction activities. 
- Pricing actions involve both the pricing offered and product mix, and the company is actively managing cost reduction initiatives. 

## Third-Party Sales and Liquidity

### Question

- Has there been an increasing number of bottlenecks in finalizing deals for third-party hardware and software sales, and how does this impact liquidity? 

### Answer

- The pace of such arrangements with traditional OEMs has a natural cadence, and regulatory pressures for sustainable mobility also play a role. 

## Cash Burn and Capital Expenditure

### Question

- How should everyone think about cash burn through next year, considering the implied step-up from previous commentary, and what is the cadence of CapEx necessary for the midsized model launch? 

### Answer

- Cash burn is influenced by capital investment, with significant spending on expanding AMP-1 in Arizona and building AMP-2 in Saudi Arabia, with continued capital expenditure expected in the next year. 
- The company has not provided specific guidance on cash burn through next year but highlights the capital-intensive nature of its growth trajectory. 

## Midsized Model Teasers and Reservations

### Question

- Have you considered providing more detail or teaser pictures of the midsized model earlier to generate interest and potentially open reservations to increase liquidity? 

### Answer

- The company believes in transparency and providing a realistic view of the product before opening reservations, as opposed to taking reservations far in advance. 

## Gravity Order Timing

### Question

- How soon before production begins will you open up Gravity orders? 

### Answer

- The company will open a waiting list for the Gravity when it feels confident in releasing more specific details about the trim and specifications of the vehicle, ensuring transparency and avoiding an environment of opacity.
