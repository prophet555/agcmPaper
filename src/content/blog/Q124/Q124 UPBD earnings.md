### Answer

## Approval Rates and Trade-Down

### Question

- Can you provide more details on the drivers of lower approval rates at Acima and discuss how potential trade-down might impact approval rates in the future? 

### Answer

- The lower approval rates are a result of a cautious underwriting approach in the current environment, considering factors like potential trade-down, customer payment performance, and the impact of the Acceptance Now conversion.
