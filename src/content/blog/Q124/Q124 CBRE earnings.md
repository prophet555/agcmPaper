## Q1 2024 Earnings Highlights

- CBRE kicked off Q1 2024 with core earnings surpassing expectations, attributed to solid net revenue growth. 
- Notable performance elements included strong leasing, underperformance in property sales due to high interest rates, and cost pressures, particularly in the Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) segment. 
- Actions are underway to address GWS cost increases, aiming for significant improvements by year-end. 
- CBRE maintains a core earnings per share outlook of $4.25 to $4.65 for 2024. 

## Financial Performance and Operations

- At a consolidated level, core EBITDA met expectations, with slight outperformance in Real Estate Investments (REI) and lower-than-expected corporate costs balancing GWS margin underperformance. 
- Advisory Services Segment Performance (ASP) was as anticipated, with a notable onetime tax benefit. 
- Advisory net revenue rose 3%, with leasing revenue growth across all regions and a notable 11% decline in property sales revenue globally. 
- GWS segment net revenue increased by 10%, with facilities and project management net revenue up by 11% and 7%, respectively. 
- GWS SOP margin on net revenue declined by 90 basis points from the prior year Q1, with more than half of the decline due to unusually large medical claims. 
- REI segment earnings were slightly better than expected, despite subdued project sales activity. The value of the development in process portfolio increased by $3 billion. 

## Outlook and Strategy

- CBRE anticipates generating approximately $1 billion of free cash flow in 2024 and aims to end the year with around 1 turn of net leverage. 
- Despite changing interest rate expectations and economic uncertainty, CBRE expects to achieve core EPS in the range of $4.25 to $4.65. 
- Advisory is expected to see mid-teens SOP growth, with leasing growth potentially offsetting subdued sales activities. 
- GWS is also projected to achieve mid-teens SOP growth, with significant improvements expected in the second half of the year as cost-cutting measures take effect. 
- REI now anticipates a more pronounced SOP decline due to continued higher interest rates, with outcomes heavily dependent on late-year market conditions for development project sales. 
- Corporate cost efficiencies are being pursued, with expectations for lower corporate costs than initially anticipated. 
- CBRE's profit growth expectations for 2024 are now more heavily reliant on controllable cost components. 

# Question and Answer

## Q1 2024 Guidance and EBITDA Outlook

### Question

- Does the guidance midpoint and the 70% back-half weighting imply a notable decline in Q2, and if so, is it related to EBITDA or EPS? 

### Answer

- The midpoint of the 2024 outlook remains unchanged, with some components adjusted. 
- Leasing in the Advisory segment is stronger than anticipated due to a healthy economy, while sales are weaker as rate cuts are delayed. 
- GWS revenue growth will be back-end loaded due to large enterprise contracts onboarded in the second half, with margin expansion expected. 
- REI is expected to see a slight decline, with a wide range of outcomes due to the timing of development monetizations. 
- Q2 is expected to see a year-over-year decline due to the back-end loaded revenue growth and margin expansion in both GWS and Advisory. 
- EBITDA is not expected to decline sequentially from Q1 to Q2. 
- Full-year EBITDA margins are expected to be higher than 2023 levels. 

## Development Project and Fee Deals

### Question

- Can you provide more detail on the significant increase in the development balance, specifically regarding the nature of the large project and whether it involves fee deals? 

### Answer

- The substantial majority of the increase is attributed to an exceptionally large industrial deal in the Sunbelt, exceeding 2 million square feet. 

## Capital Allocation and Stock Repurchases

### Question

- The company did not repurchase any stock in Q1 despite the J&J deal. Was this due to a blackout period or a deliberate decision? How should we expect stock repurchases and capital deployment in the current economic environment? 

### Answer

- The absence of stock repurchases in Q1 was related to the J&J transaction, with a focus on strategic M&A deployment. 
- Share repurchases have resumed in Q2 to a limited extent and will continue for the remainder of the year, depending on M&A activity and share price attractiveness. 
- The J&J deal represents a significant portion of the company's free cash flow for the year, limiting buyback activities. 

## Transaction Market Sentiment and Interest Rates

### Question

- What is the sentiment in the field regarding transactions and interest rates, and how are these factors influencing market activity? 

### Answer

- The company's sales and development businesses are experiencing a slowdown in activity due to a shift in interest rate expectations. 
- Both buyers and sellers are staying on the sidelines longer, waiting for more favorable pricing conditions. 
- The sentiment is different from the beginning of the year, with a more cautious approach due to the uncertainty surrounding interest rate direction. 

## Tax Benefit in Reported Core EPS

### Question

- Can you clarify the $50 million tax benefit in the reported core EPS for the quarter? 

### Answer

- The tax benefit amounts to approximately $50 million and will not repeat. 

## Growth Opportunities and Investment Priorities

### Question

- What are the significant growth opportunities within the company, and where do you see the most potential for future growth? 

### Answer

- Project and program management, particularly in infrastructure and natural resources, present significant growth opportunities. 
- The entire auction and GWS businesses are experiencing double-digit secular growth and are expected to continue expanding. 
- The development and investment management businesses are expected to lead growth over the next few years as they are at a cyclical low point. 
- The company is confident in the growth potential of all its lines of business and is actively exploring strategies to capitalize on these opportunities. 

## GWS Pipeline and Medical Claims

### Question

- Can you provide more information on the GWS pipeline mentioned and its relation to J&J contributions? Additionally, what factors contributed to the surprise in medical claims and overall cost controls? 

### Answer

- The $900 million pipeline is consistent with the company's previous outlook for GWS and does not include J&J contributions. 
- J&J is expected to contribute approximately $450 million of net revenue for the year. 
- The medical claims issue is primarily a seasonality and cadence-related matter due to the company switching healthcare providers over a year ago. 
- The impact of higher-than-expected employee medical claims has been concentrated at the gross profit line. 
- The company anticipates this issue to reverse in the remainder of the year. 

## GWS and Office Sector Rationalization

### Question

- Is the potential rationalization in the office sector, such as reductions in square footage, a concern for the GWS business, particularly in the office segment? 

### Answer

- The company does not anticipate any significant downside impact from potential rationalization in the office sector. 
- The GWS business works with clients who view their office space as a critical asset and are focused on optimizing their portfolios. 
- While some clients may explore operating with less office space, they are also considering reconfiguring and upgrading their offices, which can present growth opportunities. 

## Industrial Leasing Activity and Outlook

### Question

- How is the industrial leasing sector performing, and what are the expectations for stabilization and growth in leasing activity? 

### Answer

- The industrial leasing sector is expected to grow slightly this year and more significantly next year. 
- While some coastal markets exhibit choppiness, several major occupiers are actively reentering the market. 
- The company is optimistic about the industrial leasing sector and does not anticipate a decline in leasing activity. 

## Office Leasing by Asset Quality and Market

### Question

- Can you elaborate on the office leasing trends, specifically regarding the types of assets and markets where leasing is occurring? 

### Answer

- Office leasing activity is primarily concentrated in higher-quality assets, with record rental rates observed in major markets like New York. 
- Financial institutions and business services companies are driving demand, while the tech sector, which currently lags, is expected to rebound as companies bring more employees back to the office. 
- Second-tier markets like Nashville are also experiencing leasing activity. 

## Tax Benefit Run Rate and 2025 Outlook

### Question

- Is the $0.61 of earnings in the quarter from the tax benefit the right run rate to consider for reaching the midpoint of the full-year guidance? Additionally, is the company still on track to achieve peak earnings growth in 2025 or come close to it? 

### Answer

- The tax rate for the year is expected to be slightly over 19%, excluding the tax benefit, and around 22% including the benefit. 
- The company's path to reaching peak earnings in 2025 remains unchanged, with continued low double-digit growth expected in resilient lines of business and strong performance in the transactional side. 
- Achieving record EPS next year does not require the transactional side to return to 2019 levels. 

## Relationship Between Rate Expectations and Investment Sales

### Question

- Can you discuss the relationship between rate expectations and investment sales activity, particularly in the context of the observed slowdown in March and April? 

### Answer

- While there was an uptick in investment sales activity in the U.S. as rates increased towards the end of the quarter, this trend was not observed in EMEA and APAC. 
- The company notes that the impact of rate expectations on investment sales activity varies across regions. 

## Role of Distressed Sales in the Market

### Question

- Can you provide insights into the role of distressed sales in the market and whether there are any signs of thawing in this area? 

### Answer

- There has been some activity in distressed debt sales and selling of non-distressed debt portfolios at a slight discount. 
- Assets that are truly distressed, such as B and C office buildings, are currently facing challenges in finding buyers at current pricing levels. 
- The company expects that there will be buyers for distressed assets, but pricing may need to adjust further. 

## Discontinued Initiatives and Cost Management in GWS

### Question

- Can you elaborate on the initiatives that are being discontinued and the reasons behind this decision? Additionally, how is the company addressing cost management in the GWS business? 

### Answer

- The discontinued initiatives were not strategically important and were part of a natural process of exploring growth opportunities and adjusting priorities. 
- The cost issues in GWS are being actively addressed, with most corrective actions expected to be completed in the current quarter. 
- The company has implemented rationalization measures, including reporting some businesses to the Chief Operating Officer and eliminating a leadership layer, to improve cost management. 

## Further Details on GWS Cost Challenges

### Question

- Can you provide additional information on the cost challenges in GWS beyond medical claims, including the factors contributing to the increase and the timeline of the change? 

### Answer

- The size of the cost challenge should be considered in the context of the overall GWS business, with the issue representing a relatively small portion of total costs. 
- The company has taken aggressive action to address the cost challenges and expects most corrective measures to be implemented in the current quarter.
