# Question and Answer

## Pipeline of Opportunities and Customer References

### Question

- Is the company experiencing any pushback or increased encouragement from its pipeline of opportunities, given the large Burger King and Wendy's rollouts? 

### Answer

- The company is experiencing increased encouragement from its pipeline of opportunities. 
- Winning large customers like Burger King and Wendy's serves as a reference point for other brands, demonstrating the company's ability to handle scale and execute successful rollouts. 

## International Opportunities and TASK Acquisition

### Question

- How are discussions with international opportunities evolving, particularly with the upcoming TASK acquisition? 

### Answer

- Historically, the company faced challenges with international opportunities, but the pending acquisition of TASK has been positively received by customers and future customers. 
- The TASK acquisition addresses a pain point for many customers who require an international solution, and it provides confidence that PAR will execute on its international strategy. 
- The integration of TASK into the PAR family will enable cross-selling opportunities for payments, hardware, and additional modules, leading to potential acceleration in the TASK business. 

## SG&A Spend and One-Time Items

### Question

- Were there any one-time items in SG&A spend during the quarter that may not recur? 

### Answer

- Yes, there were one-time items related to M&A transaction fees and reorganization costs. 
- The non-GAAP adjustment in OpEx reflects a 7% organic increase year-over-year. 

## Product Roadmap Post-Stuzo Acquisition

### Question

- How will the product roadmap evolve post-Stuzo acquisition? Will there be two separate product lines for enterprise restaurant brands and C-Stores? 

### Answer

- The company is actively working towards consolidating into one application, combining the functionality of Punchh and Stuzo into a single product. 
- The consolidation process will be multi-year, but initial customer feedback has been excellent, and the company anticipates faster cross-selling of additional PAR products into this market than initially expected. 

## Hardware Business and Growth Outlook

### Question

- Can you provide more details on the hardware business, its historical performance, and the outlook for growth? 

### Answer

- The weakness in the hardware business is primarily in the non-Brink base. 
- The company anticipates that the hardware attachment on Brink will be the driver of future growth, with the potential to reach and exceed $100 million annually. 
- While achieving this level in the current year is not guaranteed, the company is optimistic about the opportunities presented by the strong Brink pipeline and recent deal wins. 

## Burger King Rollout and Implementation Progress

### Question

- How is the Burger King rollout progressing, and what is the level of confidence in having the right headcount for successful implementation? 

### Answer

- The Burger King rollout is progressing well, and the company is confident in its delivery and execution. 
- The coordination between teams is tight, and the company does not anticipate the need for additional support or increased OpEx. 

## Adjusted Gross Margins and Product Performance

### Question

- Can you provide insights into the adjusted gross margins for different products and whether the areas of drag are moderating? 

### Answer

- The adjusted gross margins for products range from low 60s to mid-70s, with Punchh and Data Central at the high end and MENU at the bottom. 
- MENU is a drag on margins but added a significant number of sites during the quarter, which will contribute to improved margins as revenue grows. 
- Payments also need to reach target margins, but the company is confident in its growth trajectory. 

## Burger King Rollout Hurdles and Visibility

### Question

- What are the potential hurdles to achieving the higher end of the Burger King revenue guidance, and what factors could impact the timeline and visibility? 

### Answer

- The company's own performance is the primary factor that could influence the Burger King rollout, and the team is confident in its execution and communication with Burger King. 
- The main variable outside the company's control is the coordination with Burger King and the choreographed nature of the rollout. 
- Any potential delays would likely stem from Burger King's internal processes or the need for additional time, but both parties are incentivized to expedite the rollout. 

## Wendy's Win and Deal Details

### Question

- Can you provide more details on the Wendy's win, including whether it was a full rip-and-replace or a more complementary solution? 

### Answer

- The Wendy's win was a significant full rip-and-replace deal, representing a major initiative and a comprehensive solution within Punchh. 

## EBITDA Breakeven and Profitability

### Question

- Given the organic ARR growth and potential cost reductions, is EBITDA breakeven or profitability achievable in the second quarter? 

### Answer

- Achieving profitability in the second quarter is possible, but the company is providing guidance to ensure it meets its commitments. 
- The software business is performing well, with expanding margins, and the company is actively managing expenses. 
- The first quarter results are not directly comparable to the fourth quarter due to one-time items, but the company is confident in its progress towards profitability. 
- The core business (Brink, Punchh, Data Central, and Payments) is driving meaningful profitability, and the addition of Stuzo and TASK will further contribute to overall financial performance. 

## Hardware Business Headwinds and Outlook

### Question

- Are there expectations for additional headwinds in the hardware business, or is the situation expected to improve in the second quarter? 

### Answer

- The company is not anticipating significant declines in the hardware business in the second quarter, and in fact, expects a potential improvement. 

## Organic Revenue Growth and OpEx Flow-through

### Question

- How should we think about the flow-through of organic revenue growth to OpEx, particularly with the expectation of flat OpEx? 

### Answer

- The flow-through of organic revenue growth to OpEx is based on the company's gross margin rate, which varies by product. 
- The company budgets for flat gross margins, but anticipates margin expansion over time, particularly in lower-margin products as utilization improves. 

## Incremental Gross Margins and Profitability Timing

### Question

- Can you clarify the incremental gross margins for different products and whether profitability could be achieved sooner than expected? 

### Answer

- Incremental gross margins are expected to be around 70%, with potential for higher margins as utilization improves, particularly in lower-margin products like MENU. 
- Based on the assumptions and calculations, achieving profitability in the second quarter is a possibility, but the company is being conservative in its guidance.
