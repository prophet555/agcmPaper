# Question and Answer

## Strong Q1 Performance and Growth Drivers

### Question

- What were the key sources of outperformance in the recent quarter, and how does the company see the trajectory for software and AppDiscovery growth beyond the AXON cycle in the gaming and e-commerce verticals? 

### Answer

- The outperformance was driven by adding more advertisers within gaming and expanding into new verticals. 
- Ongoing enhancements to the core models, which are self-learning and continuously improving, will be a key driver of future growth. 
- The company expects software to be a long-term 20%-30% grower with a focus on adding more advertisers, vertical expansion, and technology improvements. 

## AXON 2 Engine Expansion and Sales Strategy

### Question

- Can you provide an update on the AXON 2 engine's expansion outside of the gaming vertical and the company's sales strategy for new channels? 

### Answer

- The AXON 2 engine has shown success with non-gaming apps, and the company is launching web advertising on its platform, particularly targeting e-commerce. 
- The company's sales strategy remains focused on a product-first approach, leveraging successful performance in the gaming vertical to drive organic adoption and partnering with transactional categories that need more marketing solutions. 

## Header Bidding and Unity's Involvement

### Question

- What is the quarterly revenue run rate trajectory for header bidding and the MAX business, and what are the strategic implications of Unity bidding into AppLovin MAX supply? 

### Answer

- The company does not disclose specific revenue figures for header bidding but notes a positive trend and an acceleration in Q1. 
- Unity's involvement is not viewed as a significant change in the competitive landscape, as the majority of the market already bids in real-time, and AppLovin operates a fair and transparent auction with no data advantage for Unity. 

## Net Revenue for Install Growth

### Question

- Can you provide an update on net revenue for install growth and any factors influencing it? 

### Answer

- The specific figures will be disclosed in the 10-Q, but similar to prior quarters, there has been an increase in both net revenue per install and the volume of installations due to continued improvements in AXON. 

## Performance-Based Advertising and Brand Advertisers

### Question

- Why does the company focus on performance-based advertising in new verticals and not brand advertisers, and can you provide an update on the Wurl business and its contribution to revenues? 

### Answer

- The company's focus on performance-based advertising is driven by its product-first approach, belief in the power of measurable results and closed-loop attribution, and the ability to drive automatic spending increases for successful advertisers. 
- Wurl's growth and contribution to revenues are still too small to break out, but the company is focused on bringing demand online to monetize the supply it has added. 

## Capital Allocation and Incremental Margins

### Question

- How does the company think about capital allocation for organic versus inorganic growth, and what are the expectations for incremental margins as the business sustains high levels of growth? 

### Answer

- The company sees organic growth as the primary driver, leveraging its AI technology, building on partnerships, acquiring more data, and expanding its reach through existing channels like carrier OEM and CTV. 
- Incremental margins are expected to continue expanding with increased development of AXON and improvements to technology, while remaining relatively flat as volume grows. 

## Winning Advertiser Dollars and Mobile Gaming Market Growth

### Question

- Besides AXON, what factors are winning incremental advertising dollars, particularly from larger app developers, and what is your view on the growth of the mobile gaming market? 

### Answer

- The company's system does not have budgetary limitations, allowing larger advertisers to spend more based on their successful base business and the system's ability to deliver value. 
- The mobile gaming market is expected to see growth, driven by AppLovin's success in attracting billions of incremental advertising dollars through its technology and platform. 

## Competitive Dynamics and Future Outlook

### Question

- Do you see any competitors ramping up efforts to challenge your business, and how are you preparing for potential changes in the competitive landscape? 

### Answer

- The company believes its technology is highly advanced and difficult to replicate, with a multi-year head start over potential competitors. 
- Even if the company were to open-source its code, the data and feedback loop required for AI models to improve are unique to AppLovin's platform, further solidifying its competitive advantage. 
- The company remains focused on expanding its business outside of mobile gaming and sees its leadership position and AI capabilities as key differentiators that will continue to distance it from competitors. 

## Advertising Market Growth and MAX Marketplace as Proxy

### Question

- Can you comment on the underlying advertising market growth in 1Q and 4Q, and is the MAX marketplace a good proxy for the overall market? 

### Answer

- The company does not have specific figures for overall advertising market growth but notes that the MAX marketplace is a good proxy for mobile gaming advertising growth, given its leadership position and market share. 

## Interpretation of Net Revenue per Install and Volume Growth

### Question

- How should we interpret the 5% net revenue per install and 87% volume of install growth, and is there a relationship between the two that provides insights into underlying market changes? 

### Answer

- The significant increase in the volume of installations is correlated with an increase in advertiser spend, and the year-over-year rate change is influenced by the AXON 2 launch and subsequent spending growth.
