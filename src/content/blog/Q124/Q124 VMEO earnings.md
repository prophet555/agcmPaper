### Question

- What are your key priorities for the next 12 months, and what aspects of Vimeo are you most excited about after your due diligence? 

### Answer

- Excited about the opportunity to engage with Vimeo's diverse customer base, including demanding creators and blue-chip enterprise clients like NATO and Nissan.

## Guidance and Factors Influencing It

### Question

- The guidance implies a midto high single-digit revenue decline for the next three quarters. How much of this is conservatism versus potential issues in the self-serve segment? 

### Answer

- The guidance reflects a period of change with a new CEO and decisions regarding investments and future direction. 
- The company believes the low end of the revenue guide is achievable and will provide more clarity as Philip's plans solidify. 
- Bookings are expected to decelerate sequentially, with headwinds from tough comps in the Video Editing (VE) segment and reduced paid marketing. 
- The decline in bookings from the Other business in the previous year will continue to impact revenue. 
- The company plans to invest incremental EBITDA in growth initiatives, contributing to the EBITDA guidance. 

## Revenue Mix and Outlook by Product

### Question

- What is the revenue mix assumption in the guidance in terms of growth between enterprise and self-serve? 

### Answer

- The self-serve segment is anticipated to face continued headwinds, with no change in the outlook by product. 

## Vimeo Central and Early Observations

### Question

- Can you discuss the launch of Vimeo Central and any early observations on engagement, collaboration, or productivity gains? How do you expect this to translate into seat growth? 

### Answer

- It is too early to provide specific numbers as the product was launched late last year. 
- The company is excited about the concept of packaging products for enterprise customers and has a good pipeline of similar releases planned. 

## Reinvestments and Growth Opportunities

### Question

- What were the key drivers for the higher-than-expected enterprise customer additions in Q1? Can you discuss the potential for share repurchases and the strategy behind them? 

### Answer

- The enterprise business continues to benefit from customers recognizing the need for a comprehensive video platform and the strength of Vimeo's product portfolio. 
- Share repurchases will primarily focus on lowering dilution from share equity grants to employees throughout the year. 
- The new CEO expresses excitement about the enterprise business and highlights the increasing trend of organizations adopting video for marketing, internal communications, and other purposes, leading to significant opportunities for Vimeo.
