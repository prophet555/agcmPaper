## Financial Highlights

- ICE reported record first quarter net revenues of $2.3 billion, a 5% increase year-over-year pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight.

# Question and Answer

## Globalization of Gas and TTF Growth

### Question

- What is driving the rapid growth of TTF and how is it related to the globalization of gas? Additionally, how might the Biden administration's pause on LNG export licenses impact this trend? 

### Answer

- The growth of TTF is attributed to the liberalization of natural gas, allowing it to move globally as LNG, with TTF serving as the primary hedging platform. 
- The pause on LNG export licenses is seen as a longer-term concern, but with new LNG terminals coming online in Canada and the continued global movement of LNG, the impact is expected to be mitigated. 
- TTF is believed to have a significant runway for further growth, as evidenced by a 90% year-over-year increase in open interest and a 60% increase in volumes. 

## IMT Revised Guidance and Customer Base Health

### Question

- How does the revised guidance for IMT take into account changes in the MBA forecast and the interest rate outlook? Additionally, what is the current health of the customer base, particularly regarding minimum contract levels and churn? 

### Answer

- The revised guidance considers a more conservative outlook towards the lower end of the range, aligning with the updated forecasts and uncertainty around interest rates and their impact on the customer base. 
- The company expresses confidence in the long-term growth of the IMT business, citing continued customer wins and high renewal rates, with the majority of customers renewing at higher minimums and subscription levels. 
- While some customers are choosing to renew with lower minimums, they are typically opting for higher foreclosed loan fees, and the company's objective is to increase total contract value regardless of the renewal direction. 

## Institutional Connectivity in Fixed Income & Data Services

### Question

- Can you provide an update on efforts to build out institutional connectivity in the Fixed Income & Data Services business, and what is the institutional opportunity and strategy, both organic and inorganic, in this area? 

### Answer

- The company is excited about the opportunity to expand institutional connectivity within its Fixed Income & Data Services segment, leveraging the success of its muni execution and index businesses. 
- The focus is on aligning with the development of separate managed accounts and providing data solutions that ensure consistent marks and valuations for transaction values. 

## Mortgage Business On-Ramp and Servicing Trends

### Question

- How should we think about the on-ramp and revenue contribution of large financial institutions in the mortgage business, and what is driving the declines in the recurring portion of the servicing business, particularly the legacy Black Knight segment? 

### Answer

- The implementation of large clients in the mortgage business takes time due to the core nature of the systems and regulatory compliance requirements, but their contributions are expected to materialize in the latter part of this year and into next year. 
- The servicing business is performing well, with the decline in Q1 attributed to industry consolidation and some MSRs switching between subservicers. 
- The company is actively modernizing the servicing technology stack, with advancements in natural language processing, lien release automation through Simplifile integration, and Encompass integration for data and document automation. 

## Fixed Income Business Growth Drivers and Sales Process

### Question

- What are the key drivers behind the accelerated growth in the oil market, and how do you view the structural versus cyclical benefits in this market? Are we in a period of sustained higher growth, and what are the sources of this growth? 

### Answer

- The growth in the oil market is driven by long-term trends such as underinvestment in legacy energy infrastructure, electronification, evolving supply chains, the need for risk management precision, and the shift towards green energy. 
- The company's portfolio is well-positioned to address these trends, with deep and liquid products across gas, oil, and environmental markets, as well as innovations like the Murban and HOU contracts. 
- The broader energy business, including oil, is supported by the company's focus on innovation and the introduction of new contracts like RINs futures. 

## Exchange Segment Recurring Revenues and Data & Connectivity Growth

### Question

- Given the flat recurring revenues and modest growth in data and connectivity within the Exchange segment, is the company still expecting low single-digit growth for the full year in that segment? And is this dependent on the IPO environment opening up further or could there be acceleration in the data and connectivity line in the second half of the year? 

### Answer

- The company still expects low single-digit growth in the Exchange segment for the full year, with a likely pickup in the second quarter as the impact of overbilling adjustments diminishes. 
- The underlying trends remain positive, with momentum in listings and strong performance in Exchange data, particularly Futures. 

## Mortgage Segment Revenue Trends and Revenue Synergies Update

### Question

- Can you provide insights into the trend of recurring revenue throughout the year in the mortgage segment, considering the pullback in renewals and Black Knight servicing headwinds, contrasted with the progress in new business wins? Additionally, can you update us on the progress towards the $125 million revenue synergy goal? 

### Answer

- Recurring revenues in the higher end of the total revenue range are expected to be down year-over-year, reflecting pressure on renewals and potential delays in decisions. 
- The company highlights the broader growth across its business lines, such as bonds, CDS, and Futures, which helps offset the challenges in the mortgage market. 
- Progress on revenue synergies continues, with an update to be provided closer to next year. 
- The company is actively leveraging the current environment to drive client value and accelerate Encompass adoption through restructured agreements with legacy DDA platform clients.
