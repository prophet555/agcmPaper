# Question and Answer

## Stability of TPV and Business Model

### Question

- Is the assumption of TPV stability and spend-neutrality still valid for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025? 

### Answer

- Yes, the company continues to observe spend-neutrality and stabilization of spend across its customer portfolio, with no significant spend expansion. 
- This observation remains the basis for the company's business models and assumptions. 

## Bank of America Partnership Update

### Question

- Can you provide an update on the negotiations with Bank of America and the broader context of how the bank fits into the company's go-to-market strategy? 

### Answer

- The company is actively working with Bank of America, and specific details will be shared when available.

- The long-term opportunity with financial institutions is growing, and the company is excited about the potential to expand its ecosystem and drive customer acquisition through such partnerships. 

## Take Rate Expansion and Virtual Card Adoption

### Question

- Can you quantify the non-recurring benefit from migrating volume between back-end providers and provide an update on the progress of initiatives to drive virtual card adoption and increase the take rate? 

### Answer

- The one-time uptick from volume migration between providers resulted in higher monetization on a small portion of the company's volume, contributing to the significant expansion in monetization in the third quarter. 
- Excluding this one-time benefit, the company still expanded monetization in the quarter, consistent with expectations and the progress of programs to improve the product experience for customers and suppliers. 
- The virtual card program underwent improvements in the quarter, setting the stage for potential future expansion, but it did not drive a significant portion of the monetization growth in the quarter. 

## Aerobolics Partnership for Cross-Border Payments

### Question

- How meaningful could the Aerobolics partnership be in driving cross-border payment adoption in local currencies, and are there any updates on the rollout in new markets? 

### Answer

- The partnership with Aerobolics aims to provide international suppliers with the option for close-to-real-time payment clearing through local clearing, enhancing payment choice and driving adoption. 
- The company has started testing this capability in one country and plans to roll it out globally. 

## Stand-Alone FI Net Adds and Software Adoption Trends

### Question

- Were there any residual impacts from the Simple Bill Pay roll-off on the net adds for the stand-alone FI, and what are the trends in software adoption, particularly by channel? 

### Answer

- The company experienced a slight decline in FI customer adds due to the removal of some inactive customers, but it saw an increase in enrollments and the highest-ever rate of active customers within the FI channel. 
- The company's realigned teams and focused priorities have driven customer adoption, with a particularly strong acceleration in the Spend & Expense solution. 

## Embedded Strategy and Partnership Pipeline

### Question

- What factors have contributed to the recent uptick in embedded distribution partnerships, and how is the company leveraging its scale and platform capabilities to drive partnerships? 

### Answer

- The company's scale, unique payment capabilities, and regulatory compliance expertise make it an attractive partner for software providers looking to offer financial operations solutions to SMBs. 
- Partners recognize the complexity of financial operations and look to the company's scale to drive risk efficiency and effectiveness for their businesses. 
- The company's success and scale have increased awareness of the opportunity in financial operations, leading to a growing pipeline of potential partnerships. 

## Go-To-Market Approach and Customer Add Numbers

### Question

- Can you provide more details on the go-to-market approach and customer add numbers, including the acceleration in customer adds for Divvy and the FI channel churn? 

### Answer

- The company's go-to-market efforts have focused on being where SMBs are, delivering the solutions they want, and narrowing the focus to target prospects that are ready to adopt, with a bias towards slightly larger businesses. 
- The number of customer adds for BILL standalone (4,100) increased from the previous quarter, excluding the attrition associated with the Intuit Simple Bill Pay roll-off, which was minimal. 
- The acceleration in customer adds was particularly notable for the Spend & Expense solution, driven by a focus on larger businesses, lower attrition, and progress in enhancing the value proposition and scaling teams. 
- The decline in FI customer adds was mainly due to the removal of some inactive customers by partners, but the company is pleased with the level of engagement and activity within its FI customer partners. 

## Possible Outcomes of Bank of America Relationship

### Question

- Is it likely that the Bank of America relationship will continue in some form, or is it possible that they bring everything in-house? What are the potential range of outcomes, including the existence of a minimum commitment from Bank of America? 

### Answer

- The company is actively working with Bank of America, and the potential to extend the ecosystem to serve SMBs across the platform exists. 
- When more specific details are available, the company will share them. 

## Drivers of Organic Take Rate and Future Expectations

### Question

- What are the specific drivers that will contribute to getting the organic take rate back to first quarter levels, and how should we think about the gradual pickup in the take rate as we move into fiscal year 2025? 

### Answer

- The company is making progress with product improvements, such as enhanced data, payment speed, reconciliation, and local clearing on international payments, which will have a positive impact on the value proposition and adoption. 
- Growth in newer ad valorem products and the onboarding of larger businesses are also influencing the numbers. 
- The company is laying a strong foundation to return to consistent expansion and drive adoption across all ad valorem products, but it's too early to comment on the specific dynamics in fiscal year 2025. 

## Monetization of Integrated Platform Capabilities

### Question

- How is the company monetizing the capabilities of the integrated platform, and what are the benefits in terms of payment volume, customer adds, and cross-sell opportunities? 

### Answer

- The primary reason for integrating the two platforms was to drive simplicity for SMB customers, and the company has observed great progress in active activations, engagement, and cross-sell opportunities. 
- The integration enables a unified platform for managing financial operations, and the company is rolling out cash flow insights and forecasting capabilities into the platform, further enhancing its value proposition. 

## Clarification on Take Rate Dynamics

### Question

- Can you clarify the take rate dynamics in the quarter, particularly in relation to the $6 million benefit to gross profit and the potential for a one-time step-up or enduring uplift in the take rate? 

### Answer

- The $6 million benefit referenced earlier is a positive impact on cost of revenues and gross margins, not on revenue or monetization. 
- The company did make progress and expanded the take rate without including a separate one-time step-up, which was related to AR volume transitioning between providers. 
- The company expects some near-term headwinds on higher-monetizing products due to seasonality and the growth of check and ACH payments, which will limit volume expansion across those products. 
- The improvement in Q4 versus Q1 or reaching Q1 levels represents the company's expectations for the take rate. 

## Channel Mix and Customer Acquisition

### Question

- What is the current mix of customer acquisition between channel and direct (accounting vs. non-accounting) for the core BILL platform, and how do you envision this mix changing over time? Are there any initiatives to increase the contribution of the direct channel in the near term? 

### Answer

- Historically, the majority of new customer acquisitions for the core BILL platform have come from the accounting channel, and this trend is expected to continue. 
- The company is investing in and enhancing its presence in the accounting channel to drive long-term customer acquisition. 
- However, the company is also focusing more on slightly larger businesses with higher propensity to spend in the direct channel and is seeing early signs of success in this area. 
- Over time, the company expects slightly larger businesses to contribute more to revenue in the direct channel, while the accounting channel will continue to be the primary source of customer acquisition across all business sizes. 

## BILL Stand-Alone TPV and Neutrality Clarification

### Question

- Is analyzing the company's performance based on BILL stand-alone TPV excluding FI still the right approach, and is this what you meant by "neutrality" in your earlier comments? 

### Answer

- The "neutrality" referenced in the earlier comments pertained to the stability of spend and the absence of significant contraction or expansion, rather than the specific approach to analyzing the company's performance. 
- The company feels confident in its ability to drive share of wallet by adding more capabilities around payments and acquiring more customers across the platform. 

## Impact of Potential Interchange Changes

### Question

- Can you comment on the potential impact of interchange changes, or is it too early to provide specific details? 

### Answer

- It's early for the company to have any specific commentary on potential interchange changes, as they are not expected to take effect until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025. 

## Progress on Integration and Mobile Functionality

### Question

- How significant is the progress on integrating receivables with payables and the mobile functionality, and could this contribute to the flywheel effect of customer acquisition? 

### Answer

- Having an integrated mobile app with AP, AR, Spend & Expense, and cash flow insights and forecasting capabilities is crucial for driving adoption and the long-term value proposition. 
- The company is seeing increased usage from suppliers using the mobile app for Instant Transfer and creating invoices on the BILL platform. 
- The integration and mobile functionality contribute to the company's overall strategy of driving simplicity and leveraging its scale to drive further scale and product innovation. 

## Potential for TPV Per Customer Metric Improvement

### Question

- Are there any signs of improvement in the TPV per customer metric, particularly in certain categories, that could potentially accelerate in the future? 

### Answer

- The TPV per customer metric showed a slight increase in the quarter, and the seasonal effect observed in the March quarter is consistent with historical patterns for the core BILL platform. 
- While there are no large-scale signals indicating near-term expansion per customer, the company is observing strength in the T&E category, which is consistent with broader industry trends. 
- The potential for significant near-term expansion may be influenced by factors such as inflation, interest rates, and overall economic conditions impacting small business confidence. 

## Modeling Considerations for Slower Growth

### Question

- Where might slower growth occur within the business, and are there any specific areas to consider when modeling, such as TPV growth assumptions or the potential for a sequential decline in take rate? 

### Answer

- The company's core revenue guidance implies about 10% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, which is ahead of previous expectations. 
- The slower growth is expected to be most pronounced in TPV and take rate in the very short term, and these factors are incorporated into the assumptions for the fourth quarter. 
- Full-year revenue growth for the Spend & Expense solution is expected to be slightly higher than the previous guidance range of 20% to 25%, driven by volume growth. 
- Interchange is relatively stable.
