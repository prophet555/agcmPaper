## Technology Transformation Savings and Inflation Assumptions

### Question

- Is it accurate to assume that a 60% recovery level in technology transformation would result in approximately $200 million in savings, considering the initial $150 million target and the assumptions regarding inflation? [citation]

### Answer

- The company expects the technology transformation to result in more than the initially targeted $150 million in savings, likely exceeding $160 million. [citation]
- The $160 million benefit already accounts for higher wage rates, particularly in the technology sector, compared to pre-pandemic levels. [citation]
- The company's long-term contract with Google has fixed commercial terms, providing stability in Google Cloud cost inflation. [citation]

- What is the minimum liquidity required for the company, considering the debt repayment and free cash flow generation expectations? [citation]

### Answer

- Pre-pandemic, the company operated with $300 million to $400 million in actual cash, although it had higher liquidity due to a revolver. [citation]
- The company currently aims to maintain a higher liquidity balance for prudence and expects to end the year with a cash balance of approximately $750 million, which is sufficient to cover maturities off its balance sheet in 2025. [citation]
