## Average Booking Fee Growth and AI Investment

### Question

- Can you discuss the factors influencing average booking fee growth in the Travel Solutions business, its durability, and the new use cases and applications of AI, including cost management? 

### Answer

- Average booking fee growth has been driven by a favorable mix of travel types and airlines, with strength observed in the Asia Pacific region and the lodging, ground, and sea segment. 
- The company expects average booking fees to remain in a similar range throughout the year. 
- Sabre has partnered with Google to embed AI capabilities into its solutions, enhancing product development, client servicing, and data utilization. 

## Industry Growth and Corporate Travel Trends

### Question

### Answer

- The baseline assumption for air distribution bookings is flat to normal growth, but there are positive indicators, such as IATA projections, airline capacity additions, and favorable corporate booking trends, that suggest potential for higher growth. 
- The company expects average booking fees to remain consistent. 
- Corporate travel trends in the second quarter are similar to those in the first quarter, with strong performance continuing. 

## Technology Transformation Impact and Expense Outlook

### Question

- How has the technology transformation impacted win rates and renewal levels, and how should we think about technology expenses in 2024 and 2025? 

### Answer

- The technology transformation has led to a more competitive product offering, with cloud-built modularized technology that enables faster innovation and implementation. 
- The company expects approximately $45 million of cost efficiency benefits from the tech transformation in 2024, with a total of over $100 million incrementally between 2024 and 2025. 
- The Q1 run rate for technology expenses is not representative of the full year, as benefits are expected to be more backloaded due to the gradual optimization of the cloud environment and increased compute capacity. 

## Corporate Travel and Full Content Agreements

### Question

- Can you elaborate on the potential reasons for the gap between the growth rates of managed corporate travel capital and corporate bookings, and what is the share of air bookings coming from airlines with full content agreements? 

### Answer

- The company believes that a significant portion of the reported growth in managed corporate travel capital by airlines is yield-driven, and it does not see evidence of disintermediation or channel shift in managed corporate travel. 
- Sabre has full content agreements with over 100 carriers, accounting for more than 90% of its air distribution bookings. 

## Technology Transformation Savings and Inflation Assumptions

### Question

- Is it accurate to assume that a 60% recovery level in technology transformation would result in approximately $200 million in savings, considering the initial $150 million target and the assumptions regarding inflation? 

### Answer

- The company expects the technology transformation to result in more than the initially targeted $150 million in savings, likely exceeding $160 million. 
- The $160 million benefit already accounts for higher wage rates, particularly in the technology sector, compared to pre-pandemic levels. 
- The company's long-term contract with Google has fixed commercial terms, providing stability in Google Cloud cost inflation. 

## Minimum Liquidity Requirements

### Question

- What is the minimum liquidity required for the company, considering the debt repayment and free cash flow generation expectations? 

### Answer

- Pre-pandemic, the company operated with $300 million to $400 million in actual cash, although it had higher liquidity due to a revolver. 
- The company currently aims to maintain a higher liquidity balance for prudence and expects to end the year with a cash balance of approximately $750 million, which is sufficient to cover maturities off its balance sheet in 2025. 

## Hospitality Business Performance and Recent Deals

### Question

- Can you provide an update on the traction of the Hospitality Solutions business with enterprise and PMS, and comment on the recent announcements regarding deals with Wyndham and Hyatt? 

### Answer

- The company has closed two enterprise deals in the past three years, with Louvre and Hyatt, and has commenced the implementation and migration of their properties onto the SynXis CRS platform, with expectations of completing the process within 12 months. 
- The recent announcement regarding Wyndham pertains to the renewal of the PMS product, which was specifically built for Wyndham's hotel types and has been successful in supporting select service and limited service properties. 
- The company has a robust pipeline for PMS deals and is confident in its ability to win more enterprise opportunities in the future. 

## NDC Volumes and Outlook

### Question

- Can you provide an update on NDC volumes and expectations for the full year, considering the movements by major airlines towards NDC adoption? 

### Answer

- NDC volumes in the GDS sector, including Sabre, currently represent only about 1% of total air distribution volumes, but the company expects this number to grow substantially in 2024 and beyond. 
- The company's 2024 and 2025 forward-looking commentary and assumptions incorporate a significant uptake in NDC volumes.
