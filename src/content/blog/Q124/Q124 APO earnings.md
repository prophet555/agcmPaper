# Question and Answer

## Asset Management Segment Noncomp Expenses

### Question

- Why were noncomp expenses in the Asset Management segment higher, and is there a shift from placement fees to revenue sharing with distributors? 

### Answer

- The higher noncomp expenses in Q1 were due to the financial impact of decisions made to reset the cost base, both in compensation and noncompensation, and this level is expected to be normal going forward. 
- There is a variety of distribution methods for products, some involving front placement fees and others involving trailer fees against revenues, depending on the distributor and product. 
- There is no significant change in distribution methods, and different constructs are used for different products.

### Answer

- The company is seeing strong traction across all channels, particularly in the yield businesses, but also in other areas such as hybrid, equity, and infrastructure. 
- There is no fee compression observed, and the company believes the trend line growth and pipeline are strong, driven by the attractive nature of high-yield investments for insurance portfolios. 

## Capital Solutions Business and Revenue Momentum

### Question

- Can you provide an updated outlook on the capital solutions business, including notable contributors and the potential for continued revenue growth? 

### Answer

- The company is excited about the momentum in the capital solutions business, which is driven by the distribution of great ideas, increased dialogue with investors, and the intersection of trends such as the transition from private equity to private debt and the growth of asset-based solutions.

- The company is focused on measured growth and balancing the flywheel of origination, distribution, client relationships, and new avenues for funding and financing. 

## Earnings Growth Outlook and Flywheel Acceleration

### Question

- How should we think about the earnings growth potential in the context of the rapid growth of the ecosystem and the company's flywheel strategy? 

### Answer

- The company believes the private markets industry has significant potential for growth, driven by the appeal of private markets for both excess return and diversification. 
- The company is focused on delivering excess return per unit of risk and is not limited by capital flows but rather by origination and culture.

## Retirement Services Flows and PRT Business

### Question

- Can you provide insights into the retirement services flows, particularly the FAB and PRT segments, and address any concerns related to shareholder lawsuits impacting PRT business? 

### Answer

- The retirement services business is two-sided, focusing on creating spread, and the company is selective in pursuing business opportunities with wide spreads. 
- The company has built a strong asset pipeline on the liability side, but the PRT segment has seen reduced spread due to higher cost of funds, even before the emergence of lawsuits. 
- The company expects a decline in PRT volume across the industry due to the lawsuits, but this is not a significant concern for Athene given the current spreads in the PRT business. 
- The company encourages focusing on cost of funds and spread rather than flow when evaluating the PRT business.
