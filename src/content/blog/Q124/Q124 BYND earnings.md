# Question and Answer

## Sales Outlook Confidence and Market Dynamics

### Question

- What factors contribute to the company's confidence in reiterating full-year guidance despite recent pricing increases and volume fluctuations?

## New Product Cadence and Price Points

### Question

- How should we consider the timing of new product introductions and the potential movement of price points as part of the company's strategy?

## International Performance and Factors

### Question

- What factors contributed to the softer performance in the international market, particularly in Europe, which has traditionally been a strong market for the company?

### Question

- Can you provide more details on the phasing of pricing and gross margins between the first and second half of the year, and the expected contributions from pricing uplift and unit cost reductions? 

### Answer

## Customer and Competitor Reactions to Pricing

### Question

- How are customers and competitors reacting to the company's pricing increases, and how is the company factoring in price elasticity into its guidance? 

### Answer

### Question

- What is the company's expectation for gross margin and EBITDA in the second quarter, and how does this align with current analyst consensus? 

### Answer

- The company expects a significant sequential improvement in gross margin in the second quarter, driven by fixed cost absorption, price increases, and reduced trade spend.

### Question
