# Question and Answer

## Q2 2024 Guidance and Booking Window Trends

### Question

- What factors influenced the Q2 2024 guidance, and how has the booking window trend shifted? Is there any concern about the impact on the full-year outlook? 

### Answer

- The Q2 guidance reflects a pull-forward of room nights from Q2 into Q1, a less expanded booking window, and a stronger impact from the Middle East, partially offset by the benefit of Easter. 
- Despite quarter-to-quarter noise, the combined results for the first half of the year and the full-year guidance remain strong and consistent. 
- Q1 and Q2 face tougher comps, but the second half of the year is expected to benefit from easier comparisons. 

## ROI in Paid Marketing Channels and Connected Trips

### Question

- Why is the ROI higher in paid marketing channels, and is it due to efficiency improvements or overall platform performance? Can you quantify the percentage of total transactions that are connected trips and discuss the trend? 

### Answer

- The higher ROI in paid marketing channels is attributed to continuous optimization, growth in direct channels, and the effectiveness of marketing programs. 
- The percentage of connected trips as a share of total transactions is in the high single digits and growing rapidly, driven by increased customer value, higher loyalty, and repeat bookings across multiple verticals. 

## Regional Mix and Performance Marketing Channels

### Question

- Can you provide an update on the regional mix and any changes observed? Are there any insights on performance marketing channels following the implementation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in Europe? 

### Answer

- Europe saw high single-digit growth, Asia experienced mid-teens growth, and the U.S. achieved low single-digit growth in Q1. 
- The company continues to prioritize the U.S. market and has seen success, particularly in alternative accommodations, where it is making progress and improving the product. 
- The higher ROIs and marketing leverage observed in Q1 are attributed to internal actions, improvements in paid marketing approaches, and the growth of direct channels, with no significant impact from the Google DMA changes. 

## Genius Frequency and Membership Growth

### Question

- Can you quantify Genius frequency or bookings compared to non-members and discuss the path of customer progression through upper loyalty tiers? What factors contributed to the low single-digit room night growth in the U.S., and are there any specific observations for this region? 

### Answer

- The company does not provide specific numbers on Genius membership but highlights the program's growth and the value it delivers to both travelers and supplier partners. 
- Genius members tend to book more frequently and exhibit higher repeat rates, contributing to the flywheel effect of increased value and customer retention. 
- In the U.S., the sequential improvement from Q4 was encouraging, with the highest growth observed in alternative accommodations and more international bookings than domestic. 

## Differentiation and Growth Strategies in the U.S.

### Question

- Given the various strategies employed in the U.S. market, such as brand spending, paid search, the merchant product, and AI, what do you believe will be the most significant driver of future growth and differentiation within the online travel category? 

### Answer

- The company acknowledges the success of its current strategies and the incremental growth they have generated, particularly in the U.S. market. 
- The potential for transformational differentiation lies in the continued development and implementation of AI and technology, particularly Gen AI, to address traveler frustrations and enhance the booking and travel experience. 
- The company sees AI as a key driver of future growth and differentiation, offering a unique value proposition to both travelers and supplier partners. 

## ADR Trends and Summer Travel

### Answer

- In Q1, ADRs increased in Europe, while remaining flat in North America and Asia, resulting in 1% overall growth on a constant currency basis. 
- The company reports healthy growth for summer travel bookings but does not provide specific quantification. 

## Trip Planner and User Behavior

### Question

- Can you share any insights on how users with access to the trip planner feature are behaving and the potential implications for top-of-funnel activity and connected trips? 

### Answer

- While the number of users utilizing the trip planner is currently limited, the company is actively developing and learning from user interactions to understand its potential and refine its capabilities. 
- The trip planner has the potential to significantly impact top-of-funnel activity and drive connected trip bookings by simplifying the travel planning process and offering personalized recommendations. 

## Structural Growth and Fixed OpEx

### Question

- In the ongoing debate about the structural growth algorithm for online travel, what areas do you believe present the most compelling opportunities for investment to drive faster revenue growth and exceed investor expectations? Can you also discuss the factors contributing to the increase in fixed OpEx relative to bookings growth and any shifts in the business that have made it more capital-intensive or necessitated greater headcount? 

### Answer

- The company expresses confidence in its long-term growth prospects, citing the shift from offline to online bookings, increased consumer spending on experiences, and the underestimation of opportunities in direct, alternative accommodations, and Gen AI. 
- The company sees structural growth opportunities in these areas and aims to lower the growth of fixed OpEx from 2025 onwards, with increased operating leverage expected in the coming years. 

## Room Night Trends and Attractions Offering

### Question

- Can you discuss the size of the transitory impacts in Q1, such as the Easter shift, geopolitical disruptions, and booking window trends, and their implications for underlying room night trends? Additionally, what investments have been made in the attractions offering, and how is supply being managed to unlock its full potential? How does the connected trip concept facilitate bookings for attractions, which are often made closer to the trip date? 

### Answer

- Positive factors in Q1 included an expanding booking window, healthy demand in Europe, and less impact from the Middle East, partially offset by the negative impact of Easter. 
- The company primarily sources attractions supply through third-party partnerships with companies like Viator and GetYourGuide, with the recent acquisition of Fair Harbor enhancing its offerings for smaller attractions. 
- The company is prioritizing flight and ground transportation supply before fully developing the attractions offering, but sees potential in leveraging the connected trip concept to drive bookings for attractions, which are often booked closer to the trip date. 

## Alternative Accommodations Supply and Consumer Behavior

### Question

- Given the faster growth in alternative accommodations, can you provide more insights into the supply side, particularly the quality of the 7.4 million properties listed and how they differ from other platforms? Can you also discuss consumer behavior and the mix between bookings for alternative and traditional accommodations? 

### Answer

- The company does not distinguish between alternative and traditional accommodations in its approach, believing that offering both on the same platform provides a strong value proposition to consumers who often consider both options during their booking process. 
- While the company believes its alternative accommodations inventory is of high quality, it acknowledges the need for further development, particularly in certain types of properties and geographic areas. 
- The company sees opportunities to expand its alternative accommodations supply, particularly in high-end homes and certain regions, through partnerships with individual property owners and multi-property managers. 

## U.S. Market and Summer Events

### Question

- How does the unit economics of the U.S. accommodations business compare to Europe, considering factors such as brand recognition, marketing expenses, ADRs, and take rates? Additionally, how might major events in Europe, such as the Olympics, impact travel demand and behavior? 

### Answer

- The company does not disclose detailed unit economics by region due to competitive reasons and does not plan to do so in the future. 
- The company emphasizes its long-term focus on increasing value and expanding its customer and supplier base, rather than concentrating on short-term events like the Olympics.
