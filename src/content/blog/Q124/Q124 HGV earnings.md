# Question and Answer

## Bluegreen Acquisition Integration and Synergies

### Question

- How is the Bluegreen acquisition tracking compared to underwriting, and are the expected cost and revenue synergies still realistic? [citation]

### Answer

- Rebranding of sales centers and properties, as well as partnership development with Bass Pro, are key focus areas. [citation]
- The $100 million cost synergy target is considered achievable, but not expected to increase beyond that. [citation]

## Consumer Behavior and Sales Trends

### Question

- How has consumer hesitancy evolved throughout the first quarter, and what are the key drivers of sales trends? [citation]

### Answer

- There is stabilization in consumer behavior, with hesitancy primarily driven by uncertainty rather than negative trends. [citation]
- New buyers are more cautious than existing owners, but tour flow is being increased while maintaining consumer quality. [citation]
- The broader portfolio, including drive-to destinations and more affordable entry points, is seen as a positive factor. [citation]

## Loan Loss Provisions and Bad Debt

### Answer

- Loan loss provisions are expected to escalate to the mid-teens range as the business matures. [citation]
- While there was some escalation in the first quarter, factors such as propensity to borrow and mortgage levels influence the absolute dollar amount. [citation]
- The bad debt headwind is consistent with previous expectations and is primarily related to Bluegreen. [citation]

## Bluegreen Owner Hesitancy and HGV Max Rollout

### Question

- Is there any impact from the weather on Bluegreen's drive-to owner base, and what is the timeline for introducing HGV Max to Bluegreen owners? [citation]

### Answer

- Weather had a minor impact, but the main factor is anticipation and hesitation among Bluegreen members regarding the HGV Max rollout and integration. [citation]

## Fee-for-Service Business Performance

### Question

- How should we think about the fee-for-service business for the rest of the year, given the lower-than-expected performance in the first quarter? [citation]

### Answer

- Fee-for-service business accounted for 16% of contract sales in the first quarter and is expected to remain at a similar level for the rest of the year. [citation]

## HGV Max Rollout to Bluegreen Owners and Bass Pro Partnership

### Question

- Can you elaborate on the technical and legal considerations delaying the HGV Max rollout to Bluegreen owners and the expected timeline for this integration? [citation]

### Answer

- The delay is due to the need for technology and legal structuring work, similar to the Diamond integration, and a rollout is expected to begin in the fourth quarter. [citation]
- A significant increase in activity and transactions is anticipated once HGV Max is introduced to the Bluegreen owner base. [citation]

## Sales and Marketing Operating Leverage

### Question

- What drove the increase in sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter, and how will the company achieve more operating leverage in this area moving forward? [citation]

### Answer

- The increase in the first quarter was partially due to a large Ultimate Access event. [citation]
- Operating leverage will be achieved through seasonality, VPG improvement initiatives, and cost synergies on both the G&A and sales and marketing sides. [citation]

## Owner Group Participation in Hawaii

### Question

- To what extent do the two acquired owner groups, Diamond and Bluegreen, participate in the Hawaii market compared to their mainland activities? [citation]

### Answer

- Diamond members were already participating in Hawaii, and Bluegreen members are particularly excited about the opportunity to experience Hawaii through the HGV Max program. [citation]
