# Question and Answer

## Bluegreen Acquisition Integration and Synergies

### Question

- How is the Bluegreen acquisition tracking compared to underwriting, and are the expected cost and revenue synergies still realistic? 

### Answer

- The integration is progressing well, with nearly half of the $100 million cost savings target achieved on a run-rate basis. 
- Rebranding of sales centers and properties, as well as partnership development with Bass Pro, are key focus areas. 
- The $100 million cost synergy target is considered achievable, but not expected to increase beyond that. 

## Maui Update and Impact of Wildfire

### Question

- Can you provide an update on how Maui properties are recovering from the recent wildfire, and was there an earnings impact in the quarter? 

### Answer

- The Maui Bay Villas property is operating normally with improving trends, while the Ka'anapali Beach property is still impacted. 
- Sales recovery is expected to lag occupancy recovery, and full recovery is anticipated in 2025. 

## Consumer Behavior and Sales Trends

### Question

- How has consumer hesitancy evolved throughout the first quarter, and what are the key drivers of sales trends? 

### Answer

- There is stabilization in consumer behavior, with hesitancy primarily driven by uncertainty rather than negative trends. 
- New buyers are more cautious than existing owners, but tour flow is being increased while maintaining consumer quality. 
- The broader portfolio, including drive-to destinations and more affordable entry points, is seen as a positive factor. 

## Loan Loss Provisions and Bad Debt

### Question

- Why did loan loss provisions not increase significantly in the first quarter, and what are the expectations for this line item going forward? 

### Answer

- Loan loss provisions are expected to escalate to the mid-teens range as the business matures. 
- While there was some escalation in the first quarter, factors such as propensity to borrow and mortgage levels influence the absolute dollar amount. 
- The bad debt headwind is consistent with previous expectations and is primarily related to Bluegreen. 

## Bluegreen Owner Hesitancy and HGV Max Rollout

### Question

- Is there any impact from the weather on Bluegreen's drive-to owner base, and what is the timeline for introducing HGV Max to Bluegreen owners? 

### Answer

- Weather had a minor impact, but the main factor is anticipation and hesitation among Bluegreen members regarding the HGV Max rollout and integration. 

## Fee-for-Service Business Performance

### Question

- How should we think about the fee-for-service business for the rest of the year, given the lower-than-expected performance in the first quarter? 

### Answer

- Fee-for-service business accounted for 16% of contract sales in the first quarter and is expected to remain at a similar level for the rest of the year. 

## HGV Max Rollout to Bluegreen Owners and Bass Pro Partnership

### Question

- Can you elaborate on the technical and legal considerations delaying the HGV Max rollout to Bluegreen owners and the expected timeline for this integration? 

### Answer

- The delay is due to the need for technology and legal structuring work, similar to the Diamond integration, and a rollout is expected to begin in the fourth quarter. 
- A significant increase in activity and transactions is anticipated once HGV Max is introduced to the Bluegreen owner base. 

## Sales and Marketing Operating Leverage

### Question

- What drove the increase in sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter, and how will the company achieve more operating leverage in this area moving forward? 

### Answer

- The increase in the first quarter was partially due to a large Ultimate Access event. 
- Operating leverage will be achieved through seasonality, VPG improvement initiatives, and cost synergies on both the G&A and sales and marketing sides. 

## Owner Group Participation in Hawaii

### Question

- To what extent do the two acquired owner groups, Diamond and Bluegreen, participate in the Hawaii market compared to their mainland activities? 

### Answer

- Diamond members were already participating in Hawaii, and Bluegreen members are particularly excited about the opportunity to experience Hawaii through the HGV Max program. 
- Hawaii occupancy levels are strong, and the presence of Hawaii properties is expected to drive upgrade activity among Bluegreen members. 

## Bass Pro Partnership and Joint Venture Plans

### Question

- Can you provide more details on the potential structure and benefits of the Bass Pro partnership, including any timeline for announcements? 

### Answer

- The partnership includes both a marketing agreement and a JV agreement, with plans to create an experiential outdoor enthusiast brand.
