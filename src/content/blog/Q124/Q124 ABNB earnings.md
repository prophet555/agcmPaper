# Question and Answer

## Airbnb's Growth in Less Mature Markets

### Question

- Can you provide more details on the doubling of growth rate in expansion markets compared to core markets and specify which countries are included? 

### Answer

- Airbnb is focusing on markets with high potential TAM (total addressable market) such as Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Netherlands, Japan, Korea, China, and eventually India. 
- The company is seeing significant potential in these markets due to lower penetration levels and the appeal of the Airbnb brand to a younger travel population. 

## Factors Driving U.S. App Downloads Growth

### Question

- What were the key drivers behind the 60% year-over-year increase in U.S. app downloads, and how did the company achieve this growth? 

### Answer

- The growth in U.S. app downloads was primarily attributed to a focus on app optimization and user experience, rather than paid advertising. 
- The company's efforts included improving touch points, encouraging app downloads at the right moments, and highlighting the benefits of using the app over the mobile website. 
- Airbnb's success in driving app downloads reflects its ability to effectively focus on and improve specific metrics when needed. 
- The app download initiative is part of a broader strategy to perfect the core business and enhance the overall user experience. 

## Q2 Room Night Growth and Margin Guidance

### Question

- Why is Q2 room night growth expected to be flat, and does the guidance include the impact of growth investments? 

### Answer

- The Q2 guidance reflects a more stable trend in leisure travel demand compared to the previous year, with relatively consistent growth since January. 
- The company has observed lower volatility in booking lead times and a more stable booking pattern, contributing to the Q2 outlook. 
- Factors impacting Q2 margins include the timing of Easter, with the holiday benefiting Q1 and presenting a headwind in Q2, as well as one-time credits in payment processing and a shift in marketing spend timing. 
- The margin guidance does not fully account for growth investments, which are expected to have a more significant impact in the second half of the year. 

## ADR Trends and Supply Growth

### Question

- Can you provide an update on the company's value initiatives and their impact on average daily rates (ADRs)? Additionally, how should we think about the convergence of supply and night growth rates? 

### Answer

- Airbnb has implemented several value initiatives, including total price display, weekly and monthly discounts, and the compare listing tool, to address concerns about rising prices and provide a better value proposition compared to hotels. 
- These initiatives have contributed to a year-over-year decline in Airbnb ADRs, while hotel ADRs have increased, further strengthening Airbnb's value proposition. 
- The company acknowledges that the law of supply and demand plays a role in pricing, and the faster growth of supply compared to demand is helping to alleviate pricing pressure. 
- Airbnb expects supply and demand growth to align over the long term, with supply growth providing benefits in terms of affordability, quality, and differentiation. 

## Search and Inventory Quality

### Question

- How has search and conversion rates improved following the launch of Guest Favorites, and how do you ensure the quality of listings on the platform? 

### Answer

- The company has made significant progress in optimizing the search experience, with improvements in mobile app downloads, search flow, filters, and location suggestions leading to higher conversion rates. 
- Airbnb has a comprehensive roadmap for improving inventory quality, including initiatives such as Guest Favorites, quality highlights, and ongoing quality control measures. 
- Guest Favorites have been well-received by both guests and hosts, with lower contact rates, higher rebooking rates, and a positive impact on host behavior. 
- Quality highlights provide further classification and visibility into the top listings, and the company is exploring additional features such as percentile rankings and enhanced quality feedback for hosts. 
- Airbnb takes a proactive approach to ensuring quality by conducting regular audits, removing low-quality listings, providing warnings and feedback to hosts, and investing in host education. 

## Investment Priorities and AI

### Question

- Can you categorize the top investment priorities for 2024 and beyond, and how is the company leveraging AI to reduce friction and enhance the user experience? 

### Answer

- Airbnb's investment priorities are categorized into three main areas: core business, international expansion, and expanding beyond the core business. 
- The core business remains the primary focus, with investments in quality, affordability, and usability to drive immediate returns and enhance the user experience. 
- International expansion involves localizing the product and implementing a global marketing strategy, with a focus on accelerating growth in key markets such as China, Japan, and Korea. 
- Expanding beyond the core business is a longer-term initiative to transform the company into a multi-vertical platform, with a focus on experiences and other travel-related services. 
- Airbnb has been using AI for various purposes, including host support, quick replies, and reservation screening. 
- The company is increasingly focusing on generative AI, with the potential to have a significant impact on customer service by providing AI-powered concierge services and handling complex, multilingual interactions. 

## Q2 Room Night Growth and Pricing Trends

### Question

- Given the easier comps in the back half of the year, what are the micro-level innovations or potential factors that could drive stability in room night growth, and how should we think about the relative pricing trends compared to hotels? 

### Answer

- The company remains optimistic about the back half of the year, with a focus on core optimization, international investments, and growth initiatives to drive in-year growth. 
- The Q3 outlook is supported by a strong backlog of bookings, providing confidence in revenue acceleration. 
- Airbnb's ADR trends are based on global comparisons of one-bedroom listings and hotel rooms. 
- The observed ADR increases are partly influenced by a mix shift towards larger group travel, with 81% of trips now involving two or more guests. 

## Supply and Demand Dynamics in the Gig Economy

### Question

- Given the potential oversupply in the market, should we expect a similar trend to other gig economy segments where increased supply drives down prices and stimulates demand? 

### Answer

- While supply growth is generally beneficial for the platform by offering more options to guests, the impact on pricing and demand may vary by market and time period. 
- Airbnb's business model, with lower frequency of transactions and longer lead times compared to ridesharing or food delivery, may result in a different dynamic in terms of supply-demand equilibrium and pricing. 

## Icons as a Brand Positioning Strategy and Impact of Special Events

### Question

- Is the Icons initiative a leading indicator of Airbnb's strategy to revitalize and expand its experiences offerings, and how might special events like the Olympics and Euro Cup contribute to the company's growth? 

### Answer

- Icons represents a significant step in Airbnb's evolution from a home-sharing platform to a broader experiences marketplace, expanding the brand's positioning and increasing its appeal to a wider audience. 
- While Icons has a limited business impact due to its small scale, it serves as a brand investment and a way to introduce users to the concept of extraordinary experiences. 
- Special events like the Olympics and Euro Cup have historically been positive for Airbnb, driving supply growth and showcasing the platform's benefits to cities and potential hosts. 

## EBITDA Margin Guide and Investment Levers

### Question

- How are you thinking about the investment levers that provide flexibility to achieve the 35%+ EBITDA margin guide for the full year, and can we expect these levers to be utilized more throughout the year? 

### Answer

- The 35%+ EBITDA margin target reflects the company's confidence in its business model and profitability, while also recognizing the opportunity for further growth and investment. 
- Investment levers that may be utilized to drive growth include marketing spend, particularly in international markets, and product development resources to accelerate the roadmap. 

## User Profiles and Community Features

### Question

- Are the recent additions to user profiles, such as photos and travel stamps, a first step towards building out new community features, and where does this initiative stand in your priority list? 

### Answer

- The enhancements to user profiles, including photos and travel stamps, are part of a broader strategy to strengthen trust and improve matching on the platform. 
- Airbnb is investing in profile features and capabilities, recognizing the importance of trust in unlocking new opportunities and enhancing the user experience. 
- In the future, the profile is expected to play a central role in the Airbnb ecosystem, with the home becoming just one of many categories orbiting around the profile. 

## Quality Control and Host Behavior

### Question

- Can you provide more details on the percentage of low-quality supply that has been removed over time and the impact of these actions on host behavior and platform quality? 

### Answer

- The removal of low-quality supply has not had a significant impact on global bookings, as the removed listings were often less popular and had lower conversion rates. 
- Many hosts are receptive to feedback and coaching, leading to improvements in their listings and behavior. 
- Airbnb's quality control program incorporates warnings, education, and ongoing monitoring to ensure a high standard of quality on the platform. 

## Performance Marketing and Extenuating Circumstances Policy

### Question

- Can you elaborate on the strong ROI observed in performance marketing channels and whether there were any effects from the DMA rollout or changes to Google Search algorithms? Additionally, what led to the recent changes in the extenuating circumstances policy? 

### Answer

- The strong ROI in performance marketing is attributed to ongoing testing and optimization, including expanded target audiences, keyword coverage, and landing page improvements.
