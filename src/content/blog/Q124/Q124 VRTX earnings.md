## Medicare Reimbursement and Non-Opioid Alternatives

### Question

- Will the availability of non-opioid alternatives be necessary to facilitate Medicare reimbursement for VX-548 in the acute pain setting? 

### Answer

- While the primary endpoint data will be crucial for securing reimbursement, policy plays a significant role in ensuring no barriers to prescribing non-opioids. 
- Vertex is seeking a broad label for VX-548 to allow physicians the flexibility to use the product for various types of acute pain. 

## Advancement of Additional Pain Molecules

- Will Vertex consider advancing another molecule for musculoskeletal pain, potentially through a commercial partnership, to maximize value in the pain pipeline? 

### Answer

- Vertex intends to serve all patients in the pain space, including those with musculoskeletal pain, through its NAV1.8 and NAV1.7 programs. 
- The company will focus on acute and neuropathic pain with internal development and will explore partnerships for musculoskeletal pain to capture value while prioritizing one step at a time. 

## Key Decision Makers and Hospital Adoption of Suzetrigine

### Question

- Can you elaborate on the importance of hospital administrators and physician treaters in the institutional adoption of Suzetrigine for acute pain, and what factors might influence their decisions? 

### Answer

- All stakeholders, including administrators and physician advocates, play a role in decisions regarding the use of a new medicine in the institutional setting. 
- Hospitals typically go through a standardized process, involving P&T committees, to decide on formulary placement, with a focus on efficacy, safety, and the potential for opioid sparing. 

## Outcomes Data and Hospital Adoption of Suzetrigine

### Question

- What specific outcomes data might hospitals require to justify the use of Suzetrigine over opioids, and how might this impact adoption? 

### Answer

- The data demonstrating opioid sparing potential is already available and will be impactful in discussions with stakeholders. 
- Hospitals are particularly interested in the use of Suzetrigine in the discharge setting, where adoption is expected to be earlier. 

## Cell Collection for CASGEVY in the U.S.

### Question

- Can you provide any additional information on the number of patients in the U.S. who have undergone cell collection for CASGEVY and the expected growth of cell collections in the future? 

### Answer

- While specific patient numbers and details are not disclosed, Vertex is pleased with the number of ATCs activated globally and the progress of cell collection, which has already begun for many patients. 
- The company expects momentum to build throughout 2024, a foundational year for CASGEVY, with increasing activations and cell collections. 

## Pain Pipeline Differentiation and Inventory Movements

### Question

- Can you provide more details on how VX-993 is expected to be differentiated in the pain pipeline, and does its advancement to Phase II mean that VX-973, which recently completed Phase I, will not be pursued? Are there any inventory movements in the quarter that should be noted? 

### Answer

- VX-993 is a bit further ahead than VX-973 in terms of preclinical development, manufacturing, and readiness for Phase II, which is why it is advancing first. 
- Vertex is looking for molecules with both oral and IV formulations and the right drug-like properties for combination with NAV1.7, driving the selection of VX-993 for advancement. 

## Presentation of VX-548 Phase III Data and CASGEVY Pricing in the Middle East

### Question

- Can you provide insight into potential venues for the presentation of VX-548 Phase III data, and can you share any directional insight on pricing and reimbursement for CASGEVY in the Middle East? 

### Answer

- Vertex expects to present VX-548 Phase III data at fall meetings, both in congress form and through publications. 
- While specific pricing data for individual countries is not disclosed, the company emphasizes that reimbursement agreements in the Middle East reflect the transformative value and lifetime benefits of CASGEVY. 

## Formulary and Access Discussions for Suzetrigine

### Question

- Stuart, you mentioned that government programs could help incentivize reimbursement of Suzetrigine ahead of opioids in the acute pain setting. Can you provide more details on this, and do your discussions suggest that, without legislative initiatives, reimbursement for Suzetrigine is likely to occur after opioids? 

### Answer

- Policy initiatives aim to reduce financial disincentives for selecting branded non-opioids in a market dominated by generic opioids. 
- Discussions with institutions are more clinically focused on the appropriate use of Suzetrigine, while policy discussions address financial considerations and incentives. 

## Physician Expectations and CF in Brazil

### Question

### Answer

- While Vertex cannot speculate on individual institutional practices, the company does not believe it would be medically reasonable to require patients to step through generic opioids when a non-addictive, effective alternative like VX-548 is available. 
- Vertex estimates that there are around 1,500 TRIKAFTA-eligible patients in Brazil, and with a reimbursement agreement in place, the company is positioned to launch and provide access to all eligible patients. 

## Priority Review for VX-548 and Acute Pain Launch Timing

### Question

- What is the level of confidence in receiving priority review for VX-548 in acute pain, and what is the expected timeline for revenue recognition following the commercial build-out? Can you clarify the number of patients who have completed cell collection for CASGEVY? 

### Answer

- While a definitive answer on priority review will come after the submission is completed, the company's interactions with the FDA and the drug's fast track status and breakthrough designation suggest a favorable outlook. 
- The acute pain launch is progressing well, and the company will be launch-ready upon completion of the rolling submission and receipt of the PDUFA date. 
- Unlike CASGEVY, revenue recognition for VX-548 will not be delayed by an extended treatment process since it is a small molecule and will be sold and distributed in a more traditional manner. 

## Commercial Navigation of Otsuka GFR Data and Myotonia as an Endpoint
