# Question and Answer

## Guidance Change and Envato Acquisition

### Question

- How should we think about the guidance change for the addition of Envato versus organic changes to the guidance? 

### Answer

- The guidance change reflects Shutterstock's strong first-quarter performance, particularly in the data distribution and services business, and incorporates the expected contribution of the Envato acquisition, assuming it closes in the third quarter. 
- Envato is expected to contribute approximately 20% to Shutterstock's revenues and 15% to EBITDA for the full year. 

## Data Distribution and Services (DDS) Business and Computer Vision

### Question

- Is $60 million still the right number to think about for computer vision in the DDS business, considering rumors of an Apple deal? 

### Answer

- Shutterstock does not comment on specific customer deals or their contributions. 
- The $60 million reference for data should be considered as increasing, and the company's 2027 plan includes 20%+ growth for the DDS business and its components, which appears conservative based on the strong first-quarter performance. 

## Giphy Expenses and Profitability

### Question

- How should we expect Giphy expenses to pace throughout the year, considering Meta's reimbursement and Shutterstock's sales force hiring? 

### Answer

- While Meta reimburses many cash expenses, all typical salary and bonus expenses for Giphy employees impact Shutterstock's EBITDA. 
- Shutterstock is aggressively hiring for Giphy, including sales and business development professionals, to meet market demand. 
- As Giphy's revenue grows, it will positively impact profitability, and the company expects sequential profit improvement as revenue outpaces expenses from sales force hiring. 

## Data Sales Business and Envato Acquisition

### Question

- Can you provide insights into the data sales pipeline and how adding Envato to the data corpus will impact the data sales business? 

### Answer

- While specifics on the data sales pipeline are not disclosed, Shutterstock highlights strong demand in the context of a changing regulatory environment and increasing interest in ethically sourced content. 
- The acquisition of Envato, with its diverse and specific content offerings, is expected to be beneficial for the data business, as there is an insatiable demand for a variety of content types. 

## Envato Acquisition and Subscriber Base

### Question

- With the Envato acquisition doubling your subscriber base, what opportunities are there for cross-selling? 

### Answer

- The acquisition of Envato presents various cross-selling opportunities, including offering content not currently available to Envato customers, potentially increasing retention and upselling opportunities. 
- Additionally, the acquisition is expected to complement Shutterstock's offerings for small and medium-sized customers, filling a gap between packs and larger subscriptions. 

## New Guidance, Envato Acquisition Timing, and Content Business Trends

### Question

- Does the new guidance assume Envato will be added to revenues and EBITDA from the start of Q3, and can you discuss trends within the content business, including any month-on-month improvement and observations from April? 

### Answer

- The acquisition of Envato is more likely to close in the back part of Q3, and the company feels confident about the deal. 
- Positive trends are observed in the small and medium business, indicating that charging for content has been well-received, leading to increased downloads and customer engagement. 
- Shutterstock expects its content business to return to growth in the back half of the year and anticipates year-over-year growth in content to improve each quarter, both in terms of percentage and sequential revenue contribution. 
- The company is encouraged by what it is seeing in April and believes that extracting itself from the free trial model was the right strategic move for building a more sustainable and faster-growing content business. 

## Data Demand Beyond LLMs and Go-to-Market Strategy

### Question

- As the pace of building GenAI applications accelerates, where are you seeing demand for data beyond LLMs, and how has your go-to-market strategy evolved to monetize this data opportunity? 

### Answer

- Shutterstock is experiencing demand from both new and existing customers for greater scale in existing content types, specific metadata, and specialized content types. 
- There is a misconception that visual media content is only needed for companies training image or video generators, but in reality, multimodal models require visual media training data even for chat-based or large language models. 
- Shutterstock's pipeline and distribution are trending positively, with strong demand across various model types, particularly as multimodal applications become more prevalent. 

## Giphy Business Challenges and Monetization Timeline

### Question

- What are some of the challenges in scaling up the Giphy business, and when can we expect a more meaningful impact from Giphy on your top line? 

### Answer

- Restarting any business from a cold start involves challenges such as reestablishing relationships with potential advertisers and securing budget allocations. 
- However, Shutterstock believes the market is moving in its favor, and it is seeing high interest and an increasing average order value (AOV), indicating a positive trend for Giphy's advertising model. 
- While the company does not provide an exact timeline for significant revenue contributions, it is making progress each month and is confident in overcoming the hurdles associated with building a successful ad platform. 

## Giphy Business and Potential Partnerships

### Question

- Given that Giphy is an advertising business, do you think a potential third-party partnership with a larger platform could expedite its monetization? 

### Answer

- Shutterstock acknowledges the potential for partnerships with larger platforms to accelerate the monetization of Giphy and confirms that it is exploring such opportunities with interested parties. 

## Data Deal Recognition and Contributor Base Growth

### Question

- Were the data deals signed in the quarter all recognized ratably, and can you provide any color on whether data revenue grew year-on-year? Additionally, what trends are driving the growth in the contributor base and library? 

### Answer

- Shutterstock increasingly structures data deals to recognize revenue over time, leading to inherent lumpiness in the business despite a growing base of recurring revenue. 
- The company is excited about the momentum in data, Giphy, and studios, considering them as three large total addressable market (TAM) opportunities with significant growth potential. 
- The growth in the contributor base and content library is driven by the evolving market trends and Shutterstock's expanded acceptance of content for data purposes, leading to increased demand and supply across various content types and use cases. 
- The company's content-centric approach and ability to identify supply gaps and fill them through acquisitions contribute to the positive trend in contributor base growth.
