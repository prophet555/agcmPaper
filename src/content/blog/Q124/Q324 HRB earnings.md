# Question and Answer

## EIT Market Share Loss and Mitigation Strategies

### Question

- How can the company mitigate the assisted market share loss on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) side and potentially turn it around? 

### Answer

- The company acknowledges the challenge and is focused on addressing it through a combination of the right message in the market, the role of refund advance, pricing and value adjustments, and improving the overall client experience, particularly for lower-income clients. 
- The company is also attracting higher-value clients with more complex tax situations, aiming to strike a balance between serving both lower and higher-income clients. 

## Factors Contributing to Market Share Loss

### Question

- Was the majority of the market share loss in the assisted category due to EITC clients? 

### Answer

- While EITC clients were a significant factor, the company also observed experienced breaks in the overall client experience, particularly in managing expectations and demonstrating expertise, which led to a higher number of clients not completing their tax preparation. 
- Client surveys revealed that the top reasons for not completing tax preparation were a perceived lack of expertise and poor expectation management by H&R Block. 
- The company is focused on addressing these execution challenges to improve conversion rates and retain clients who choose H&R Block but do not complete the process. 

## Sustainability of NAC Growth

### Question

- Can the company sustain the current Net Average Charge (NAC) growth on both the assisted and DIY sides in the future? 

### Answer

- The company's strategy for NAC remains unchanged, with a focus on delivering value and evaluating client feedback to determine appropriate pricing. 
- In the DIY segment, NAC growth is expected to continue through mix changes and modest price increases, with attention to competitive dynamics. 
- In the assisted segment, the company will assess client feedback and continue to believe that price can play a role in driving growth. 

## Monetization of AI Tax Assist and Human Help

### Question

- How does the company plan to monetize the AI Tax Assist and human help features within its paid online DIY products? 

### Answer

- The inclusion of AI Tax Assist and human help in the paid online DIY products has contributed to their growth and value proposition. 
- While it is too early to determine the specific monetization strategy for Gen AI, the company believes it can enhance the customer experience and is actively testing different approaches. 
- The company is successfully monetizing human help through the Tax Pro Review product, which has shown consistent growth over the years. 

## Impact of Filing Extensions

### Question

- What was the impact of filing extensions, particularly in California, on the company's growth this year, and are there any extensions this year that could affect results? 

### Answer

- Last year, filing extensions, particularly in California, had a significant impact on industry growth, with California alone accounting for approximately a 1% decrease in year-over-year growth. 
- This year, while there have been some extensions, they are relatively small compared to last year and are not expected to have a material impact on the industry's overall performance. 

## Source of DIY Market Share Gain

### Question

- Was the DIY market share gain, particularly from TurboTax, in the paid online segment or across all segments? Can you elaborate on how this was tracked and what the company observed? 

### Answer

- The DIY market share gain was observed across the board, with some clients coming from TurboTax's free offering and others from their paid offering. 
- The company's strong performance in the paid SKU suggests that a portion of the market share gain came from TurboTax's paid offering, given their significant presence in the market. 

## IRS DIY Filing Data

### Question

- Do you have an estimate of the proportion of paid versus free DIY filings in the overall industry, given the IRS data showing 2.7% growth in the DIY category? 

### Answer

- The company does not have specific data on the industry breakdown between paid and free DIY filings. 
- However, the company is pleased with its own performance, as its paid DIY growth significantly outpaced the overall category growth, indicating a strong year for H&R Block in the DIY segment. 

## Timing of Marketing Spending

### Question

- The press release and comments mentioned a shift in the timing of marketing spending. Was this a pull-forward or a pushback, and will it have any impact on the full-year results? 

### Answer

- The shift in marketing spending was a result of more spending occurring in Q4 this year compared to Q3 last year. 
- The company does not anticipate a significant change in full-year marketing spend as a result of this timing shift. 

## Performance of Company-Owned vs. Franchise Operations

### Question

- Can you provide more details on why company-owned operations outperformed franchise operations, and was it solely due to franchise repurchases? 

### Answer

- The difference in performance between company-owned and franchise operations was primarily due to franchise repurchases. 
- While company-owned operations drove revenue growth through higher volumes, the relative outperformance was not as significant compared to franchise operations due to the impact of franchise repurchases. 

## Assisted Market Share Underperformance

### Question

- Where is the company losing market share in the assisted category, given the 1.2% decline in volume compared to the category's 1.2% growth? 

### Answer

- The company does not have specific information on where it is losing market share but will have a better sense after filing the Freedom of Information report in the fall. 
- The focus is on addressing experienced breaks in the client journey, particularly in managing expectations and demonstrating expertise, to improve conversion rates and retain clients. 

## Impact of Tax Day Outage

### Question

- Can you provide an update on the tax day outage in the downloaded software business and its likely impact on fourth-quarter results? 

### Answer

- The tax day outage, which affected a small number of clients and was resolved within a few hours, was not material to the business or its results. 
- While it may have been an inconvenience for those clients, it did not significantly impact the company's operations. 

## IRS Direct File Program

### Question

- What are your thoughts on the IRS Direct File program, which recently achieved its goal of 100,000 filers in 12 pilot states? 

### Answer

- The company remains confident in its stance on the Direct File program, believing that it is a solution in search of a problem given the availability of over 30 organizations offering free tax preparation services. 
- The company's strong DIY paid growth performance suggests that the Direct File program has not had a significant impact on its business. 

## Competitive Dynamics in the Assisted Category

### Question

- Have there been any noticeable changes in competitive behaviors or dynamics from TurboTax in the assisted category, considering their increased focus on this segment? 

### Answer

- The company has not observed any signs that TurboTax's actions are impacting its assisted business. 
- The primary competitive difference noted this year was TurboTax's promotional and sweepstakes-driven approach, which may have had some impact, but the company believes its own execution challenges were the primary factor in underperformance. 

## Reasons for Assisted Filers Not Completing

### Question

- Can you elaborate on the reasons why assisted filers did not complete their tax preparation, particularly regarding the management of expectations and the potential impact of tax credit changes? 

### Answer

- The primary reasons for assisted filers not completing their tax preparation were related to execution, particularly in managing expectations and providing a clear understanding of the process, timeline, and cost. 
- The company acknowledges the impact of newness in the retail environment and virtual tax preparation methods on its ability to execute effectively but remains focused on improving the client experience. 

## Impact of Modified Tax Pro Compensation

### Question

- Will the changes in tax pro compensation, specifically the modified structure, have any material financial impact this year compared to the original guidance? 

### Answer

- The changes in tax pro compensation are expected to be cost-neutral, with no significant financial impact beyond the original guidance.
