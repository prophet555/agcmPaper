# Question and Answer

## Network Changes and Forward Bookings

### Question

- Can you discuss the network changes made and the results seen in forward bookings, particularly in the second quarter, considering the margin improvement guidance and capacity growth? 

### Answer

- The network changes, which started in April and will continue through the summer, have resulted in new routes with load factors in the 90s, exceeding expectations. 
- While these changes are expected to have a 5 to 10-point drag on RASM due to the significant increase in new flying, the company believes it is the right investment for optimizing the network. 

## Profitability Outlook and Margin Targets

### Question

- Do you expect to be profitable every quarter going forward, given the higher margin target for 2025? 

### Answer

- Yes, the company expects to be profitable in every quarter going forward. 

## Cost Reduction and Impact on Cost Line

### Question

- Can you provide insight into where the $200 million of cost reductions will impact the cost line as the company transitions to more out-and-back flying? 

### Answer

- The $200 million cost savings plan is on track and will benefit operations across the board. 
- Areas of impact include lower travel-related costs, crew efficiency improvements, benefits in station operations, higher capture rates from maintenance at crew bases, and increased utilization from network simplification. 

## Capacity Guidance and Schedule Refinement

### Question

- The observed schedules suggest that second-quarter capacity may be higher than the guidance provided. Is there a level of conservatism around completion or ongoing schedule refinement? 

### Answer

- The company acknowledges potential air traffic control and weather issues while striving to provide realistic capacity guidance. 

## Yield and Load Factor Dynamics

### Question

- How do you expect the yield and load factor dynamic to evolve throughout the year, and what impact is the lower load having on ancillary performance? 

### Answer

- The lower load factor had a positive impact on non-ticket performance in the quarter, with some recovery observed in January, February, and March. 
- The company focuses on optimizing total revenue output and will adjust load factors and yields accordingly. 

## UpFront Plus and Domestic Yield Trends

### Question

- How has the recently introduced UpFront Plus seating option trended since its launch, and what are your observations on domestic yield trends as we move into the second quarter and the back half of the year? 

### Answer

- UpFront Plus has exceeded expectations and provides customers with the option to purchase more space at the front of the aircraft, catering to a specific customer segment. 
- The company sees overall capacity increasing and anticipates a positive landscape for the markets it serves, with higher fares and good demand for the summer. 

## Short-Haul Leisure and International Performance

### Question

- Can you discuss the short-haul leisure market, particularly in Puerto Rico, and the performance of the international segment beyond Puerto Rico? 

### Answer

- The company sees an attractive opportunity in Puerto Rico due to its cost base and the potential to stimulate a market with historically high fares. 
- While the international segment has performed well, the commentary on overcapacity may apply to other destinations in the region, not necessarily where Frontier is starting service. 

## New Market Performance and RASM Impact

### Question

- Can you elaborate on the comment about new markets having a 5 to 10-point drag on RASM, considering the expectation that these are better markets? 

### Answer

- The company is pursuing higher-yield opportunities with these new markets and expects them to produce a higher RASM once matured. 
- However, as brand-new markets, they are likely to generate lower revenue initially, resulting in a temporary drag on RASM. 
- This drag is expected to be in the high single digits and flow through to margin due to the significant increase in new capacity, but improvements are anticipated as these markets mature. 

## Aircraft Deliveries and Capacity Growth

### Question

- How many aircraft are you planning to take delivery of this year, and are you experiencing any delays similar to other carriers? 

### Answer

- The company is still expecting 23 deliveries for the year, with all 321neo aircraft expected in the second quarter and 11 in the back half of the year. 
- While there have been delays from the original order, these delays have been known for over six months and are not significantly impacting the business. 

## Aircraft Utilization and Out-and-Back Flying

### Question

- What drove the 6% decline in aircraft utilization, and are you still aiming to achieve 12-plus hours of utilization with the network changes? 

### Answer

- The decline in aircraft utilization was due to managing oversupply in the January and February off-peak periods. 
- The company expects utilization to be up in the high 11s and 12s for the rest of the year as the network changes and out-and-back flying progress. 

## Flight Attendants and New Schedule

### Question

- Was the issue raised by flight attendants regarding the new schedule and potential earnings impact resolved? 

### Answer

- The issue was resolved through negotiation, as the company did not agree to a guarantee of a minimum amount of multi-day trips. 
- While some flight attendants prefer multi-day trips, the company's growth and hiring strategy are expected to provide more opportunities for such trips within a year. 

## Cost Advantage and Competitive Landscape

### Question

- How significant is your cost advantage relative to the PR Group, and does it still matter given changes in route network operations across the industry? 

### Answer

- The cost advantage remains crucial, as evidenced by the company's outperformance and ability to achieve its margin targets despite challenges in the industry. 
- The company's focus on maintaining and widening its cost advantage through continued efficiency and cost-saving initiatives is key to its success. 

## Sale-Leasebacks and Business Model

### Question

- As sale-leaseback proceeds become increasingly important in offsetting CASM, have you considered potential changes to how the business is managed when these proceeds eventually fade? 

### Answer

- The company reiterates that the sale-leaseback model is a core part of its business and provides real cash flows and earnings, similar to debt financing. 
- The company has a clear path with 200 aircraft on order and does not foresee any changes to this strategy unless the financing market shifts. 
- The market value for aircraft, particularly the A321neo, is strong, contributing to the benefit derived from the sale-leaseback model. 

## Crew Base Costs and Network Changes

### Question

- Is there a cost mismatch when opening new crew bases, such as Cleveland, as the company transitions to an out-and-back network, or do the cost savings from network simplification offset the initial investment in base openings? 

### Answer

- The $200 million cost savings target is underpinned by network simplification and the shift to over 80% out-and-back flying, providing efficiency and cost savings across the operation. 
- The upfront investment in base openings is relatively small compared to the benefits of moving assets to locations where they generate revenue. 

## Pilot Negotiations and Market Dynamics

### Question

- Can you provide an update on pilot negotiations and any new developments in the current market environment? 

### Answer

- The landscape has changed significantly, with airlines canceling classes and attrition rates slowing. 
- Negotiations are in the early stages, and the process typically takes one to two years. 

## Competitive Response and Regulatory Changes

### Question

- What competitive responses are you seeing, particularly from network airlines, in light of your new products and route network changes? Additionally, what are your thoughts on recent DOT rule changes regarding customer compensation for flight delays and lost bags? 

### Answer

- The company is observing typical reactions from competitors, but the industry as a whole is focused on margins, and rational carriers are expected to adjust pricing and capacity accordingly. 
- The company is implementing changes to its website, app, and merchandising to address transparency concerns and comply with the new DOT rules. 

## Supply Dynamics and Revenue Initiatives

### Question

- Can you provide more details on the current supply dynamics in your network and how they relate to your confidence in revenue initiatives, such as business rework and loyalty programs? 

### Answer

- The company believes it peacefully coexists with network airlines by catering to a different market segment and offering a different product. 
- The company's focus on optimizing revenue through yield and load factor management is expected to lead to improvements as the year progresses and the network changes take full effect.
