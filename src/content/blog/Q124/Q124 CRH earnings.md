# Question and Answer

## Americas Materials Pricing Dynamics

### Question

- Can you discuss the pricing dynamics and price-cost trends in the Americas Materials segment, specifically for aggregates and cement, and whether the double-digit pricing guidance for the year still holds? 

### Answer

- Q1 aggregate pricing was up 8%, influenced by geographic mix and seasonality, but on a mix-adjusted basis, pricing was up double digits, in line with the full-year guidance. 
- Cement pricing was up 9% across the group, supported by strong underlying demand, and positive pricing is expected to continue throughout 2024. 

## Texas Cement Market and Pricing

### Question

- Can you provide an update on cement pricing in Texas, particularly in the southern part of the state where imports may be impacting the market? 

### Answer

- Cement pricing in Texas is similar to the national trend, with good support and no concerns. 
- Positive pricing is expected in Texas for cement, as well as other downstream businesses like aggregates, asphalt, and ready-mixed concrete. 

## U.S. Market Demand and Backlog Trends

### Question

- The U.S. market saw stronger-than-expected volumes. Can you elaborate on the drivers of this demand, including fundamental factors, weather, and the backlog trends for the year? 

### Answer

- The strong demand in the U.S. market is attributed to a mix of favorable weather and the execution of significant projects in the backlog, particularly in the Great Lakes region and out West. 
- While weather may have had some impact, the absolute volume shift is relatively low, less than 10% of total aggregate shipments for the year. 
- Backlogs reflect early momentum and are supported by federal and state funding initiatives, with margins improving across all lines of business, including Roads and critical infrastructure projects. 

## Fly Ash Supply and Impact on Cement Business

### Question

- Can you discuss the potential impact of fly ash shortages on the cement business, both in the short term due to recent supplier issues and in the longer term as coal-fired plants are phased out? 

### Answer

- CRH has been proactive in addressing fly ash supply challenges by actively exploring and utilizing alternative materials like pozzolans and SCMs in its markets. 
- The company has the capabilities to blend and integrate these materials for customers and has access to alternative sources, mitigating the impact of fly ash shortages. 
- The experience and expertise gained from dealing with similar issues in the European market provide a significant advantage in addressing fly ash challenges in the U.S. 

## 2024 Guidance and M&A Activity

### Question

- Can you elaborate on the factors influencing the 2024 guidance, including the positive Q1 performance, new synergies, further M&A, and the impact of recent divestments? 

### Answer

- While the year has started well, it is still early, and the company has been active in M&A, with eight bolt-on acquisitions completed and the announcement of Texas synergies. 
- The contributions from bolt-ons and Texas synergies are largely offset by the divestment of cement and materials assets in Quebec, resulting in a minimal difference from the previously stated guidance. 
- The company remains confident in its full-year guidance and highlights its focus on operational execution, strategic investments for future growth, and disciplined capital stewardship. 

## Hunter Cement Plant Synergies and Integration

### Question

- Can you provide an update on the integration of the Hunter cement plant in Texas, including progress on achieving synergy targets and any insights gained from the initial phases of integration? 

### Answer

- The company is satisfied with progress on the Hunter cement plant integration, with $60 million in synergies identified so far and ongoing evaluation of additional opportunities. 
- Key value drivers include the plant's position as the largest building materials supplier in Texas, its unique downstream businesses that consume cement, and the potential for network optimization with other CRH assets in the region. 
- The experience gained from the successful Ash Grove acquisition, where profitability was doubled in six years through operational improvements and best practice sharing, provides a valuable playbook for optimizing the Hunter plant. 
- Additional opportunities lie in procurement and leveraging CRH's size and scale to drive cost efficiencies. 

## M&A Pipeline and Valuations

### Question

- Can you provide an update on the M&A pipeline, including visibility and valuations? 

### Answer

- Valuations in the M&A market continue to be high, but CRH's ability to deliver synergies and drive shareholder returns justifies these prices. 
- The M&A pipeline is strong, with approximately $4 billion in deals expected to be completed this year, and the company will continue to focus on building out its footprint and reallocating capital to higher-growth areas. 

## U.S. Index Inclusion and Americas Building Solutions

- Can you provide an update on the winter fill program for liquid asphalt and asphalt, and how it positions the company for the summer season, as well as insights into the significant growth in paving revenues and the role of the solutions approach in gaining market share? 

### Answer

- The company manages its liquid asphalt and asphalt business on a margin basis and maintains storage capabilities to ensure availability and supply chain resilience during the off-season. 
- The company is in a similar position in terms of both the quantum and pricing of liquid asphalt compared to last year, with a focus on margin protection through various strategies. 
- Backlogs for paving, which provide a good indication of future performance, have improved in both dollar volume and margins, indicating positive momentum as the season progresses.

Additionally, can you clarify the net M&A contribution to net debt and whether there are additional outflows related to bolt-ons beyond the Texas acquisition? 

### Answer

- Given the strong underlying demand and positive market conditions, the company is evaluating targeted opportunities for a potential second price increase in the U.S. cement market in 2024. 
- The $1.9 billion net M&A contribution to net debt includes the outflow from the Texas acquisition, inflow from the European Lime divestiture, and regular bolt-on activity.
