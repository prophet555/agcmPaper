## Investment Requirements for English Content and Marketing

### Question

- Can you discuss the potential magnitude and timeframe of investments required for creating English content and marketing the English learning capabilities of Duolingo? 

### Answer

- The content creation for advanced English courses is already completed, with the use of generative AI significantly reducing the time and cost compared to manual creation methods. 
- The company does not anticipate significant spending on content creation for English courses.

### Answer

- The company has been diversifying its marketing channels away from TikTok for over a year, with investments in Instagram and YouTube shorts that have proven to be effective alternatives. 
- TikTok views in the U.S. account for a minority of overall TikTok views, and the company is not overly concerned about a potential ban in the U.S., as users are likely to migrate to other platforms where Duolingo already has a presence.

### Answer

- The company has observed improved cohort conversion rates across all cohorts from 2023, leading to healthy subscriber conversion and strong growth in subscription bookings. 
- The continuous improvement and appeal of subscription tiers, particularly the Family Plan, contribute to the positive subscriber conversion trends. 

## Margin Outlook and Investment Priorities

### Question

- Can you elaborate on the factors influencing the margin outlook and the potential for margin outperformance in the future? 

### Answer

- The higher-than-expected incremental margin in Q1 was influenced by the timing of expenses and the capitalization of certain projects. 
- The company has a significant number of investment priorities, including English learning, math and music courses, and the core subscription business, which will drive margins closer to the long-term target of 35%. 

## Duolingo Max Rollout in Cost-Restricted Markets

### Question

- Are there any markets where the rollout of the Duolingo Max tier is currently restricted due to the costs associated with generative AI? 

### Answer

- The company does not plan to roll out Duolingo Max in markets with low monetization potential, such as India, where the cost of generative AI is currently prohibitive.

## LTV to CAC Dynamics for Duolingo Max

### Question

- How do the lifetime value (LTV) to customer acquisition cost (CAC) dynamics compare across the various subscription plans, including Duolingo Max, and what is the company's approach to optimizing these ratios? 

### Answer

- The company primarily focuses on the LTV side of the equation due to the significant contribution of organic word-of-mouth referrals to customer acquisition. 
- The Family Plan currently has a higher LTV than the Super Plan, and Duolingo Max is expected to have a higher LTV over the medium term as pricing and costs are refined. 
- The company is actively working to find the right feature set and pricing structure for Duolingo Max to ensure strong LTV to CAC ratios.

- The company has not observed any concerning trends in user health or at-risk paid subscribers in 2024. 

## Factors Influencing Payer Ratio Fluctuations

### Question

- What factors contribute to fluctuations in the payer ratio, particularly across different geographic and language corridors? 

### Answer

- The company clarifies that Q2 is typically a slower quarter due to seasonality and the absence of one-time promotional events that occur in other quarters. 
- These normal course variations in payer ratios and bookings are not driven by specific product changes but rather reflect the organic growth patterns of the business. 

## Duolingo's India Market and Subscription Potential

### Question

- Can you provide insights into the dynamics of the Indian market, particularly regarding the potential for paid subscriptions, and whether there is a price point that could make subscriptions more appealing in India? 

### Answer

## Margins and AI Investment by Cohort

### Question

- Can you discuss the margin profiles of different subscription cohorts, such as Max and Family Plans, and the impact of AI investment costs on these cohorts?
