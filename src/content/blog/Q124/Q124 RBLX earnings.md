# Question and Answer

## Content Quality and Live Events

### Question

- Are there any changes in the pace or quality of content hitting the platform, and how many live events are planned for the year and their impact on the platform? 

### Answer

- In Q1, there was a more distributed distribution of content, with new experiences gaining market share and increased velocity of new experiences entering the top 20. 
- The company plans to hold live events every 1 to 2 months, with the next event focused on highlighting the platform's strength in diverse content and featuring experiences with over 1 million daily actives. 

## Bookings Growth and KPIs

### Question

- What factors are driving bookings growth outpacing DAUs and hours engaged, and is the 20% growth target still appropriate for the longer term? 

### Answer

- The company aims for all key metrics (DAUs, hours, bookings) to grow at a consistent 20% rate, with recent trends showing improvement and all three metrics in the U.S. and Canada exceeding 20% in the last three weeks. 
- While bookings growth has outpaced DAUs and hours engaged due to increased monetization, the company expects these metrics to move in lockstep over time. 
- The 20% growth target for 2025-2027 is still believed to be achievable based on current trends and the business's growth potential. 

## 2025 Outlook and Advertising

### Question

- Is the lower guidance for 2024 a one-time event, and what is the outlook for 2025 in terms of growth drivers, including advertising versus the core business? 

### Answer

- The lower 2024 guidance is primarily due to lapping PlayStation and Easter, and the company expects to continue growing the core business at the rates discussed in November 2023. 
- Advertising is expected to be a nice increment to the business in 2025 but not a substantial driver of overall growth until 2026-2027. 
- The company plans to provide guidance on advertising for the first time early next year and believes it has a strong foundation and momentum in that area. 

## EBITDA Margin and Investment Plans

### Question

- Why has the EBITDA margin remained stable despite the slight decrease in the top-line guidance, and has there been any change in the investment plan? 

### Answer

- The EBITDA margin has stayed consistent due to operating leverage in the business, particularly on fixed costs like infrastructure, trust and safety, and headcount. 
- CapEx is also coming down as planned, contributing to stable profitability and free cash flow generation. 
- The company's strong unit economics and cash flow generating ability provide flexibility to deliver similar cash flow despite the lower top-line guidance. 

## Q1 Engagement Drivers

### Question

- What factors contributed to the engagement recovery in Q1, and how does the Q2 guidance reflect this? 

### Answer

- The engagement recovery in Q1 was driven by a combination of factors, including performance improvements, the rollout of dynamic heads, increased use of voice on the platform, and a focus on quality and performance across various areas. 
- The Q2 guidance reflects caution in extrapolating the recent positive trends into the future and aims to provide a prudent and rational outlook. 

## Developer Engagement and Content Distribution

### Question

- Was the challenge with new content a result of both user and developer engagement moderating, and how is the company addressing this? 

### Answer

- The company is actively engaging with top creators and developers through initiatives like developer days and focusing on optimizing the long-term health of the platform by ensuring all creators, including those in the top 300, see growth opportunities. 
- Efforts to flatten and distribute the content curve have led to increased visibility and engagement for a broader range of creators, and live events like The Hunt have also contributed to content discovery and creator exposure. 

## Product Launch Pipeline and Moderation

### Question

- Has there been any moderation in the pipeline or product launch initiatives, particularly in the areas of advertising, economy, and AI, for Q3 and Q4? 

### Answer

- The company has a robust pipeline of initiatives across various areas, including advertising, economy, AI, and content/live ops, and is continuing to drive progress and launch new features. 

## Branded Experiences Engagement and Monetization

### Question

- How does the engagement and monetization of branded experiences compare to traditional non-branded content on the platform? 

### Answer

- While it's still early to provide specific metrics, branded experiences generally see higher engagement than traditional video content, with interactive movie trailers, for example, offering deeper engagement and interaction opportunities. 

## Walmart Discover and In-World Shopping

### Question

- How is the Walmart Discover experience performing, and what is the timeline for a broader rollout of in-world shopping features? 

### Answer

- In-world shopping is in the early stages, and the company is not incorporating corporate revenue from this feature into its 2024 or 2025 models. 
- The Walmart partnership is a positive step in exploring commerce opportunities on the platform, and the company is excited about the potential for in-world shopping to offer a new and engaging way for users to shop together in the future.
