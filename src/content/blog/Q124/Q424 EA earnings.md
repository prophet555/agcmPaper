## Breakdown of Live Services by Genre

### Question

- Can you provide a rough breakdown of the live services bucket by genre, such as sports, action shooter, and casual games? 

### Answer

- However, it is highlighted that massive online communities, such as those for FIFA, The Sims, and Apex Legends, are significant components of the live service business. 

## Differentiation Through Live Services

### Question

- How does EA's approach to live services differentiate the company and position it for growth compared to the broader market?

- EA's mobile business is well-positioned, with a focus on leveraging its existing massive online communities and investing in a limited number of mobile-native titles with breakout potential. 
- The company's growth outlook for FY '26 and '27 is demonstrated through the new non-GAAP operating margin disclosure, with an expected expansion of 150 to 200 basis points from the FY '25 platform.
