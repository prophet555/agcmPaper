# Question and Answer

## Private Label Price Gaps

### Question

- Why have the price gaps for private label products widened, despite the decline in branded volume? 

### Answer

- The inclusion of a larger set of customers, including a major hard discounter, in the data has provided a clearer perspective on the market. 
- Retailers are investing in private label to meet consumer demand for value, as highlighted by recent media coverage. 

## Cocoa Pricing and Volatility

### Question

- How is the company approaching pricing in response to cocoa commodity volatility, considering its hedging practices and the potential for pass-through contracts? 

### Answer

- The company hedges cocoa on a more short-term basis compared to national brands, aligning with delivery cycles and contract commitments. 
- Recent significant inflation in cocoa prices has prompted the company to take pricing actions and engage in factual discussions with customers, who have responded positively. 

## EBITDA Cadence and Full-Year Outlook

### Question

- Does the EBITDA cadence guidance suggest a potential for higher normalized earnings power beyond the $400 million previously mentioned, considering the progress in derisking the supply chain? 

### Answer

- The confidence in the back half of the year is driven by top-line progress, a robust cost savings pipeline, and the return to service in broth production, which was a significant factor in not achieving the $400 million target last year. 

## New Business Wins and Pipeline Impact

### Question

- What is the timing of when new business wins and the increased pipeline would start impacting the P&L, and how does this contribute to visibility in the back half of the year? 

### Answer

- The pipeline is expected to start delivering results in Q3 and Q4, providing confidence in the back half of the year. 
- Constructive conversations with regional customers and their continued investment in private label are encouraging. 

## Broth Plant Disruption and EBITDA Impact

### Question

- Is the disruption in the broth plant still tracking towards the previously mentioned $20 million EBITDA impact, and how are the costs phased between Q1 and Q2? 

### Answer

- The impact is slightly higher than anticipated, but the company is on track with its plan and believes it will be within the expected range. 
- The impact was likely more significant in Q1 than Q2 due to the ramp-up curve, but production is ongoing and the company is confident in its progress. 

## Retailer Promotion of Private Label

### Question

- Are retailers expected to become more promotional with private label in the second half of the year, similar to the trends observed in the seasonal timeframe? 

### Answer

- Yes, increased promotional activity is anticipated in high seasonal categories like refrigerated dough and coffee, driven by both margin considerations and greater confidence in the supply chain compared to the previous year. 

## Cocoa Category and Pass-Through Contracts

### Question

- Considering the significant movements in cocoa prices, is there a possibility of adopting pass-through contracts similar to coffee for this category? 

### Answer

- While pass-through contracts are effective for highly volatile commodities like coffee, the current cocoa price increases appear to be more structurally driven. 
- If the cost changes are indeed more permanent, pass-through contracts may not be as suitable as the current hedging approach. 

## Private Label Trends and Business Wins

### Question

- Are there any other key private label wins or losses, in addition to the recent Walmart announcement, that you can discuss? 

### Answer

- The company has been actively building its pipeline and focusing on capabilities and capacity following the divestiture, leading to a solid pipeline and alignment with growth opportunities. 

## Working Capital and Payable Days

### Question

- The working capital use this quarter was mentioned, but payable days were also lower. Is this a deliberate decision to capture better terms, or will payable days return to normal levels in the future? 

### Answer

- The lower payable days are likely a function of timing rather than deliberate decisions, and historical levels are expected to be maintained with no pressure on vendor terms. 

## Working Capital Guidance

### Question

- Was there any guidance provided on working capital for the year, particularly regarding whether it will be a use of cash? 

### Answer

- No specific guidance was provided on working capital for the year, but free cash flow is expected to be at least $130 million. 

## New Business Wins and Broth Facility Progress

### Question

- Were the new business wins part of the original guidance or are they offsetting any delays in the Broth facility, and is there any change in the competitive bidding environment for private label volumes? 

### Answer

- The new business wins are a natural progression and were not part of the original guidance. 
- The competitive bidding environment remains category-specific, with the company performing well in areas where it has deep capabilities and cost structure. 

## Capital Allocation and M&A Landscape

### Question

- What is the outlook for capital allocation between potential acquisitions and share repurchases, considering the M&A landscape and recent acquisitions? 

### Answer

- The company's first priority for capital remains investing in the business, primarily through capability-driven acquisitions that address key business gaps and growth opportunities. 
- While transformational M&A is not expected in the near term, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases are also important priorities. 

## Labor Inflation and Automation

### Question

- Can you provide insights into labor inflation for manufacturing facilities and any opportunities to leverage automation to address potential challenges? 

### Answer

- The company has observed some labor inflation but has proactively addressed it by ensuring the right labor pool, paying competitive wages, and making investments in shift schedules and other areas to attract and retain talent. 
- The company's improved balance sheet and transformation have enabled investments in automation, such as cobots and automated forklifts, to supplement labor where it is tight and enhance workforce efficiency. 

## OEE Improvement and Manufacturing Efficiency

### Question

- To what extent is the improvement in Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) due to better visibility in plants, automation, or lower labor turnover and increased employee experience? 

### Answer

- The improvement in OEE is attributed to a combination of factors, including investments in the Toyota Manufacturing Operating System (TMOS) and consistent plant operations, as well as maintenance activities to enhance equipment reliability.
