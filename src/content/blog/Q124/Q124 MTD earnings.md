# Question and Answer

## Organic Growth and Earnings Guidance

### Question

### Question

- What are the expectations for China in Q2 and the rest of the year, and are there any signs of improvement or "green shoots" in the market?

### Question

### Answer

## Biopharma Outlook and Budget Spending

### Question

- What are the assumptions regarding biopharma customer budget spending and any signs of improvement in activity levels? 

### Answer

- The company expects biopharma to remain soft in Q2, similar to the first quarter, due to inventory issues and slower spending.

- There are positive signs of increased interest in single-use sensors for biopharma customers. 

## Services Business Performance and Initiatives

## Areas of Conservatism in Q2 Guidance

### Question

- Can you discuss any areas of conservatism in the Q2 guidance, particularly regarding the slower sequential increase, and provide more context on the Industrial side? 

### Answer

- The slower sequential increase is partly due to the shipping delay benefit in Q1, but the multi-year CAGRs for Q2 and Q1 are generally similar. 
- The Industrial business, which has a higher percentage of China exposure, is experiencing higher comps on a multi-year basis, contributing to the sequential differences.
