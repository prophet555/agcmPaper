# Question and Answer

## Comfort with Canadian Market Trends and Visibility

### Question

- How comfortable are you with the trends in the Canadian market, particularly regarding student visas and immigration controls, and what visibility do you have into the second-half recovery and recapture rates? 

### Answer

- There is now considerably more clarity in the Canadian market, with schools having a better understanding of their permit allocations and the process for admitting students. 
- The actual results are expected to be less extreme and more manageable than initially feared, providing more comfort for moving forward. 
- The company's guidance is based on a bottoms-up model, taking into account school-by-school perspectives and recapture assumptions for international students going to countries outside of Canada. 

## Impact of FX on Full-Year Guidance

### Question

- Can you provide more information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on the full-year revenue guidance and any considerations for presenting FX-neutral guidance in the future? 

### Answer

- The full-year guidance is based on constant currency, with the main driver being foreign exchange fluctuations. 
- The company is exploring the possibility of presenting FX-neutral or constant currency growth rates in the future to provide a clearer view of the underlying business performance. 
- The company experienced a $1.2 million FX headwind in Q1 due to gradual strengthening of the dollar, and this headwind is expected to increase in subsequent quarters if current exchange rates persist. 

## Impact of Current FX Rates on Full-Year Guidance

### Question

- Given the recent movements in foreign exchange rates, what would be the incremental impact on the full-year revenue guidance if current FX rates were used instead of rates at the end of the first quarter? 

### Answer

- Using current FX rates, the incremental impact on the full-year revenue guidance would be minimal, estimated to be less than $1 million and spread somewhat evenly across the quarters. 

## Total Addressable Market (TAM) Growth and Drivers

### Question

- Can you provide more details on the high single to low double-digit TAM growth expectations, including the contribution of pricing, tuition increases, and the growth in the number of international students across different geographies? 

### Answer

- The company expects low to mid-single-digit growth in international student numbers over time, with factors such as tuition increases and average transaction size contributing to TAM expansion. 
- The company also sees a significant opportunity in the land-and-expand strategy within the education vertical, as well as a tailwind from increased adoption of automated payment solutions across various industries. 

## Components of Full-Year Guidance and Reacceleration

### Question

- Is the full-year guidance change solely attributed to FX and Canada, or are there other factors at play? Can you provide more details on the components of the reacceleration in the second half of the year, including the implied growth rates and the impact of the healthcare business? 

### Answer

- The full-year guidance change is primarily driven by the impact of FX and the Canada market, but there are other puts and takes across the portfolio, with softness in the healthcare business also contributing to the reacceleration in the second half. 
- The reacceleration in the second half is expected to be driven by a mid-single-digit acceleration from the first half, with a significant portion attributed to Canada and the healthcare business recovering. 
- The healthcare business is expected to benefit from good go-lives of clients in the second half and a push from the first half due to delays in patient billing following a cyber incident involving Change Healthcare. 

## New Customer Additions and Business Performance

### Question

- Can you provide more information on the strength in new customer additions, including the distribution across segments and any additional color on the drivers of this performance? 

### Answer

- The company saw strong new customer additions across various segments, with travel leading in terms of the most count but education also performing well. 

## Impact of Q1 Performance on Full-Year Guidance

### Question

- Can you clarify the reasons for the change in the full-year guidance for Canada, considering the less extreme impact of permit issuances than originally feared? Is the change primarily due to Q1 performance or are there other factors at play? 

### Answer

- The change in the full-year guidance is primarily due to Q1 performance, with the company experiencing a slightly greater impact than initially expected. 
- The less extreme impact of permit issuances in Canada has provided more confidence in the market, but the expansion of the guidance range is a result of Q1 performance and the need to ramp back operations for the rest of the year. 

## Factors Contributing to Q2 Guidance Range

### Question

- What factors beyond FX and Canada are contributing to the wider range in the Q2 guidance compared to previous quarters, and what visibility do you have into the remaining two months of the quarter? 

### Answer

- The wider range in the Q2 guidance is due to factors such as the rolling ramp in Canada and the need to capture a range of potential scenarios. 
- The company is monitoring various trends in the business but acknowledges that there is still more time in the quarter to observe performance. 
- The guidance range also accounts for the potential of a snapback in Canada, which has not been observed, and aims to provide a comprehensive view of potential outcomes. 

## Modeling and Recapture Assumptions

### Question

- How was the mid-single-digit recapture assumption for international students in countries outside of Canada determined, and are there any areas outside of Canada where similar situations are developing? How confident are you in the expectation of international student numbers increasing over the medium to long term? 

### Answer

- The mid-single-digit recapture assumption is based on the company's experience and conversations with agents and partners about how they are planning to assist students in finding alternative study destinations. 
- The company feels confident in this assumption and believes it is well-captured within the range of guidance for the year. 
- While there are headlines about potential regulatory changes in other markets, the company has seen strength and confidence in various areas, such as the U.K., Australia, the U.S., and China.
