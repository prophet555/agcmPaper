# Question and Answer

## Arm's Infrastructure Business and Market Share in the Cloud

### Question

- How is Arm's infrastructure business, particularly in the cloud, performing compared to the IPO projections, and what factors are contributing to its growth? 

### Answer

- Arm's infrastructure business, particularly in the cloud, is experiencing accelerated growth due to increased investment in data centers for AI applications, which benefit from Arm's power efficiency. 
- The integration of Arm's CPU with NVIDIA's GPU in products like Grace Blackwell enables higher memory bandwidth and faster training and inference applications, further driving Arm adoption in the data center. 

## Armv9 Conversion and Licensing Growth

### Question

- How does the v9 conversion rate compare to v8, and what factors are contributing to its faster adoption? 

### Answer

- The v9 conversion rate is expected to be faster than v8 due to the presence of a strong infrastructure business and rapid adoption in the premium handset segment. 
- The v9 conversion is projected to reach the high end of the market share within 2 to 3 years, with increased royalties from v9 subsystems contributing to long-term growth. 

## Arm's Role in the Accelerated Data Center and AI Trend

### Question

- How is Arm positioned to benefit from the trend towards accelerators in the data center, and what is its role beyond the head node of accelerated servers? 

### Answer

- Arm's focus on performance per dollar and its ability to provide a cost advantage through chip and system integration make it well-positioned to address the increasing use of accelerators in the data center. 
- Arm's flexibility and ecosystem support enable custom implementations and interconnect features, driving further adoption in the data center beyond the head node. 

## Licensing Mix and Rebound in Fiscal Year 2025

### Question

- Will the licensing mix rebound in the second half of fiscal year 2025, and what factors will contribute to this rebound? 

### Answer

- The licensing mix rebound is expected to be broad-based, driven by the focus on AI capabilities across various end markets. 
- Royalties from smartphone shipments with Armv9 are expected to kick in during calendar year 2025. 

## Royalty Growth and China Royalty Revenue

### Question

- Can you clarify the drivers of the over 50% sequential growth in China royalty revenue in the December quarter and provide a breakdown of the drivers for the March quarter? 

### Answer

- The sequential growth in China royalty revenue was primarily driven by a mix shift in the Chinese consumer market, with a transfer from Chinese customers buying from Chinese producers to those outside of China. 
- The March quarter is expected to see similar trends, with accelerated growth in both China and the rest of the world. 

## June Quarter Royalty Outlook and Drivers

### Question

- What is driving the sequential decline in royalty revenue for the June quarter, and can you provide more details on the factors impacting unit volume and pricing? 

### Answer

- The sequential decline is driven by weakness in networking and industrial IoT markets, while the mobile market is expected to be relatively consistent. 
- The decline in unit volume is expected to be partially offset by growth in blended royalty rates, particularly from the v8 to v9 transition and mix effects. 

## PC Potential and Arm's Growth in the Windows Ecosystem

### Question

- What are Arm's thoughts on the potential for PCs over the next few years, particularly in the Windows ecosystem, and how does Arm's experience in the Apple ecosystem contribute to its growth expectations? 

### Answer

- Arm is optimistic about the growth potential for PCs, particularly in the Windows on Arm segment, due to the need for a diversified supplier base offering multiple options for end consumers. 
- Arm's success in the Apple ecosystem and its performance, battery life, and fanless design advantages position it well for significant market share growth in the Windows ecosystem. 

## Long-Term Licensing Revenue Growth and ATA Conversion

### Question

- Is the 10% long-term licensing revenue growth target still applicable, and how challenging will it be to convert the remaining half of the top 30 customers into ATA licensees? 

### Answer

- The 10% long-term licensing revenue growth target remains valid, driven by the continued positive momentum in licensing activity due to the demand for AI capabilities and Arm's strong position as the logical choice for partners entering AI-driven markets. 
- It is estimated that approximately 80% of the customer base could eventually move to ATA licenses, providing increased predictability in license renewals. 

## Automotive v9 Profiles, CSS Engagements, and Licensing Recognition
