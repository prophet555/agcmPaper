# Question and Answer

## Blue Revenue Potential and Adoption

### Question

### Answer

- The quantity of blue material in a display is similar to green, indicating a substantial revenue potential. 
- However, the disclosed green revenue includes yellow-green emitters, and blue pricing with customers is not yet finalized. 
- The adoption of blue OLED technology is expected to be gradual and dependent on customer decisions and timelines. 

## Blue Pricing and Customer Feedback

### Question

- How will blue OLED pricing be determined, and what has been the customer feedback regarding its benefits, such as lower power consumption? 

### Answer

- Blue OLED pricing will be based on the value proposition of the product, including its energy efficiency benefits. 
- Phosphorescent blue OLED technology is more energy-efficient, with an estimated 25% increase in display energy efficiency by adding blue material. 
- Customer feedback has been positive, leading to continued progress in blue material development and expectations of increased development sales in 2024 compared to the previous year. 

## Seasonality and Revenue Outlook

### Question

- What is the expected seasonality for the current year, and how does the strong Q1 performance impact the full-year guidance? 

### Answer

- Historically, the company has had a second-half orientation to revenues, but this year is expected to be more balanced between the first and second half. 
- The Q1 performance, driven by factors such as the iPad launch, does not necessarily imply no growth for the rest of the year, but the company is optimistic about its full-year guidance.

- Some new products, particularly in the IT sector, feature tandem structures, which may have influenced demand. 
- The company refrains from providing further details on the specific impact of tandem structures on individual customers. 

## R&D Expense Increase

### Question

- The R&D expenses have increased sequentially and year-over-year. Could you elaborate on the reasons behind this increase? 

### Answer

- The increase in R&D expenses is attributed to ongoing investments in inventing new materials, reflecting the company's commitment to innovation. 
- Additionally, higher employee costs, both in R&D and SG&A, contributed to the overall increase. 
- The rise in development expenses with outside parties also played a role in the higher R&D costs.
