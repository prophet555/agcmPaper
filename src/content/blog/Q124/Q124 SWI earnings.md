# Question and Answer

## Selling Environment and Results

### Question

- How does the current selling environment compare to previous quarters, and how much of the company's recent success is attributed to execution versus market conditions? 

### Answer

- The selling environment remains consistent with previous quarters, with the company's value proposition resonating well with customers. 
- The upside to estimates is primarily due to the company's execution and focus on controllable factors rather than significant changes in buying behaviors or selling patterns. 

## Observability Solutions and GenAI Adoption

### Question

- As GenAI adoption increases, is there a noticeable impact on customer interest and adoption of observability solutions, or is it too early to determine any specific trends? 

### Answer

- While it's still early to identify a strong pattern, the company is experiencing early success and traction with GenAI, particularly in areas like predictive analytics, alert fatigue reduction, and service management platform efficiency. 
- The ability to implement GenAI capabilities within the observability platform exists but is not an immediate or high-demand feature from the industry. 

## Subscription ARR Growth and Composition

### Question

- Can you provide more details on the drivers of subscription ARR growth, specifically the contributions from expansions within the existing customer base versus migrations? 

### Answer

- Subscription ARR growth is primarily fueled by the company's subscription-first strategy and the conversion of existing customers to the Hybrid Cloud Observability product. 
- The healthy uplift in conversions, with $1 of maintenance typically converting to almost $1.60 of subscription revenue, is a significant factor in driving subscription ARR growth. 

## Company Growth and Shift to Subscription Model

### Question

- The company's total revenue growth guidance for the year is lower than the total ARR growth rate. Is there a scenario where the company phases out new perpetual licenses and fully transitions customers to a subscription or hybrid cloud model over time? 

### Answer

- Over time, there is a possibility of phasing out new perpetual licenses and fully transitioning to a subscription model, driven by the company's product focus, packaging, and value proposition. 
- However, this transition should be based on the value delivered to customers and not forced, as the company views the subscription transition as a value model transition as much as a business model transition. 
- The trends in subscription growth, increased consolidation around the SolarWinds platform, and the ability to up/cross-sell to existing and new customers suggest a gradual shift towards a subscription-based model. 

## Maintenance Migration Strategy and Impact on New Logo Adds

### Question

- Has the company implemented any new strategies or initiatives to drive maintenance migration, particularly within the observability solutions, and how has this impacted new logo additions? 

### Answer

- The company's strategy for maintenance migration to subscription, especially for observability solutions, involves starting in North America and expanding to EMEA and APJ. 
- The increased traction in EMEA, as part of the flywheel motion initiated in 2023, is driving observability solution sales and contributing to the decline in maintenance base. 
- The focus on migrating existing customers to subscription products may result in a decrease in new logo additions to the license and maintenance space. 

## Hyperscaler Cloud Growth as a Leading Indicator

### Question

- Should the acceleration in cloud revenue reported by hyperscalers be considered a leading indicator for SolarWinds' cloud growth, particularly with the increasing contributions from GenAI and other projects? 

### Answer

- While the hyperscaler cloud growth may provide a tailwind for SolarWinds, it is currently not a significant part of the company's business or a dependency for success. 

## Q1 Results and Full-Year Guidance

### Question

- The company delivered strong revenue performance in Q1 but reiterated its guidance for the full year. Does this indicate that some of the outperformance in Q1 was due to deals being pulled in from other quarters, or is there a more cautious outlook for the remainder of the year? 

### Answer

- The balanced performance in Q1 suggests that the outperformance was not due to deals being pulled from other quarters. 
- The full-year revenue guidance is a result of considering all external factors, including macroeconomic conditions, and maintaining a conservative approach to modeling. 
- As the year progresses, the company will continue to provide updated guidance.
