### Trends, Market Conditions, Sentiment

- **Mid-Cycle Environment**: Anticipated to remain enhanced for the refining industry, supported by strong demand, constrained global supply, and the advantage of the U.S. refining system.
- **Capital Discipline**: Continued focus on investing in high-return projects and maintaining capital discipline while committing to returning excess capital through share repurchases.
- **Midstream Growth**: MPLX identified as a strategic advantage, expected to continue increasing its cash distributions and supporting MPC's capital returns and dividend payments.
- **Share Repurchases**: Commitment reaffirmed with an additional $5 billion authorization, with total capital return since May 2021 reaching $35 billion.
