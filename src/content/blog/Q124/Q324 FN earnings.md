# Question and Answer

## Telecom Revenue Outlook and 400ZR Demand

### Question

- Can you provide more color on the telecom revenue outlook, the sustainability of DCI demand, and the duration of inventory digestion? 

### Answer

- Telecom softness is expected to continue for a few more quarters, potentially into early to mid-2025, due to ongoing inventory digestion. 
- Growth in telecom is driven by 400ZR technology, which is experiencing some lumpiness but remains a strong point with 5 customer engagements. 

## Datacom Sequential Growth and 1.6T Product Ramp

### Question

- What was the underlying sequential growth in datacom excluding the rolling off of the 100 gig business, and any thoughts on the timing of the 1.6T product ramp? 

### Answer

- Datacom business grew 6% sequentially and 150% year-over-year, demonstrating strong growth even with the 100 gig product rolling off. 
- The industry is transitioning to higher data rate products, with less than 10% of optical revenue coming from products rated at less than 100 gig. 800-gig demand remains robust, and the introduction of 1.6T products is expected to complement rather than replace 800 gig. 

## Customer Design Wins and Engagements for 800G and 1.6T

### Question

- Can you discuss the broadening of customer design wins and engagements for both 800 gig and 1.6T, and how this ties in with the better-than-expected product transition for 800 gig? 

### Answer

- 800 gig demand remains strong, and the company is optimistic about supporting the next-generation 1.6T products. 
- While there are other engagements outside the main customer, they are still in early stages, and the focus is on supporting the main customer and being well-positioned for both 800 gig and 1.6T products. 

## AOC vs. Active Copper Cable Products in Data Centers

### Question

- Can you highlight the opportunities for AOC-based products versus active copper cable products in data centers for 800 gig and 1.6T, and if there is any cannibalization between in-rack and short-reach connectivity? 

### Answer

- The company has not observed any cannibalization of demand with copper, and there are specific applications where copper interconnects are used without significantly impacting the company's offerings. 
- Optical interconnect demand in AI data centers appears to grow exponentially with data center expansion, and the introduction of 1.6T products is not expected to cannibalize 800 gig; both are anticipated to coexist and drive growth. 

## AI Connectivity Market Size and 1.6T Adoption

### Question

- Can you share your impressions of the size of the AI connectivity market and how the conclusion that 1.6T will be additive to the mix, rather than cannibalize 800 gig, speaks to the overall size of the opportunity? 

### Answer

- The view that 1.6T will be additive is based on the architecture of products in the pipeline, particularly from Nvidia, where 1.6T appears to complement rather than cannibalize 800 gig. 
- There has been no significant change in perception in the last 90 days, and the timing and magnitude of the 1.6T ramp remain to be seen. 

## Capacity Planning and Facilities Expansion

### Question

- Are there any plans for increased capacity or facilities expansion to accommodate potential growth in demand for 800 gig and 1.6T products? 

### Answer

- The company evaluates capacity needs regularly and has some space opening up with the 100 gig program transferring out. 
- Building 8 is nearly full, but the capacity expansion into Building 9 is progressing well and ahead of expectations. 
- While there are no immediate announcements, the company is closely monitoring capacity requirements and the pace of expansion in Building 9, and is prepared to add additional capacity as needed. 

## Timeframe for Capacity Expansion

### Question

- What is the typical timeframe from making a decision on capacity expansion to breaking ground and ramping up capacity? 

### Answer

- From the decision-making process to being fully operational, the timeframe is approximately 18 months, with some variability. 
- The company has the necessary experience and processes in place to execute a similar expansion to previous projects.
