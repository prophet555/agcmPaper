# Question and Answer

## Company Guidance Range and Uncertainty

### Question

- Why does the company's 2024 guidance range span 8%, and what specific factors contribute to the persistent uncertainty? 

### Answer

- The company attributes the broader guidance range to the high growth levels and volatility experienced in recent years, as well as the need to be cautious due to Danish regulations for listed companies. 
- The management team indicates that there are no major changes to the risks, either positively or negatively, and reiterates that they are on track and confident in their base plan. 

## High-Dose Injectable Semaglutide (Mim8) Phase II Trial and Dose Selection

### Question

- Did the Phase II trial of high-dose injectable Semaglutide (Mim8) find a weight loss plateau, and can you provide insights into the additional weight loss gained at 8 milligrams and 16 milligrams? Are further trials at even higher doses being considered despite the ongoing Phase III trials at 7.2 milligrams? 

### Answer

- The company declines to comment on the specific data and weight loss observations from the trial at this time. 
- The focus on evaluating further development in diabetes and confidence in higher doses for obesity is based on data from the diabetes trials, and the company remains optimistic about higher doses in the obesity space. 

## Wegovy Supply Progression and Uptake, and Ongoing Launches

### Question

- Can we expect a continued gradual ramp of Wegovy starter doses throughout the year, and how is the supply situation evolving, particularly in the U.S. and China? 

### Answer

- The company reports a significant increase in Wegovy starter dose prescriptions in the U.S., exceeding 25,000 per week, indicating confidence in the supply chain and the ability to scale. 
- While not providing specific guidance on new prescription growth, the company suggests that the acceleration and growth for the remainder of the year will be driven by Wegovy expansion in the U.S., TRx ramp, and continued launches in volume-capitated markets. 

## Mim8 Target Product Profile and Competitive Positioning

### Question

- Can you provide more details on the target product profile for Mim8 and how it compares to competitors, particularly in light of their new administration profiles? 

### Answer

- The target product profile for Mim8 focuses on achieving an annual bleeding rate of zero, with an expectation of more than 50% of patients experiencing no bleeds throughout the year. 
- The company anticipates an attractive safety profile, a true monthly dosing profile, and a convenient, pain-free injection experience with an easy-to-use device. 

## Wegovy Coverage and Uptake Post-SELECT Trial

### Question

- Has the approval of Wegovy for obesity in the U.S. based on the SELECT trial data helped improve coverage and access, and what is the outlook for further expansion? 

### Answer

- The company currently covers over 50 million people living with obesity in the U.S., and while there is room for growth, they are pleased with the level of access. 
- The label expansion based on the SELECT trial data, making Wegovy the only anti-obesity medication with proven cardiovascular benefit, has already had a positive impact, with CMS allowing for reimbursement in Medicare Part D. 
- The company expects a gradual uptake with a couple of million lives covered initially and anticipates further expansion and taking advantage of the SELECT data. 

## ESSENCE NASH Trial Outcome and Commercial Competitiveness

### Question

- What would be a good outcome of the ESSENCE NASH trial to give you confidence in the commercial competitiveness of the drug, and has there been an acceleration in the timeline for the readout? 

### Answer

- The company is hoping to see results similar to those observed in the Phase II trial, which showed a significant and clinically relevant improvement in steatosis and fibrosis, as well as a good safety profile. 
- Positive results in the Phase III trial would indicate an attractive profile and support the FDA's grant of breakthrough designation based on the Phase II data.
