- The company observed some pressure in retention rates from banks and asset managers, particularly in the research business, but overall retention remains strong at 94%.

- Downside risks include inflation, Fed actions, geopolitical tensions, and election uncertainties, leading to a more measured approach to the issuance outlook.

### Refinancing and M&A Trends 

- Issuers are addressing upcoming maturities, with some potential pull-forward from 2025 and beyond in the second half of the year.
- The significant amount of pandemic-era leveraged loan issuance provides a solid underpinning for future issuance, with a large portion maturing in 2027 and beyond.

- The company is mindful of spending, investing strategically, and building efficiencies into the system, leading to a stable outlook at the consolidated level.

## Impact of FX and Research & Insights Growth

### FX Impact and Revenue Guidance 

- The update in MA revenue outlook is primarily driven by FX, with a slight impact from sales seasonality.
- No material impact from FX was observed in the first quarter.

- Moody's has held the issuance forecast range and expects a mid-single-digit decline in issuance for the remainder of the year, with a more significant decline in the fourth quarter.

## Capital Allocation and Balance Sheet

### Capital Allocation and Share Buyback 

- Moody's maintains its approach to capital allocation, with a focus on share buybacks and deleveraging.
- The pace of share buybacks in the first quarter is in line with planned cadence, and the company expects to catch up in the second quarter and second half to meet targets.
