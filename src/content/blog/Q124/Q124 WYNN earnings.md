# Question and Answer

## Macau Market and Competitive Landscape

### Question

- How would you characterize the current competitive landscape in Macau compared to previous quarters? 

### Answer

- Macau is a competitive market, and Wynn focuses on product and service quality to attract the best guests. 
- While there are questions about promotional activity, Wynn's competitive strength lies in its product and service offerings, as demonstrated by Q1 results and margins. 

## Las Vegas Market and Future Performance

### Question

- How do you anticipate the tough comp stack in Las Vegas impacting future performance, considering the strong results in February and continued positive trends in April? 

### Answer

- While acknowledging that comps are getting tougher, the strength of Wynn's offerings in Las Vegas, including service quality and amenities, contributes to its pricing power. 
- The target customer base has seen strong wealth creation, and the EBITDA setup is favorable due to the majority of deployed capital and debt being in "yesterday's dollars." 
- The company remains optimistic about current performance, but acknowledges the need to monitor trends and comp comparisons. 

## Macau Gross Gaming Revenue and Casino Revenue Conversion

### Question

- What factors contributed to the sequential improvement in the conversion of gross gaming revenue to casino revenue in Macau, and is it indicative of a systemic change in reinvestment? 

### Answer

- The primary driver of the sequential improvement is the revamp of Wynn's loyalty program, which offers customers choice in how they want their reinvestment allocated. 
- This allocation can vary quarter by quarter, impacting the flow of funds to contra revenue or operating expenses, but it is not indicative of a systemic change in aggregate reinvestment. 

## Macau Operating Expenses Trajectory

### Question

- As the Macau market normalizes, what is the expected trajectory for underlying core expense growth or inflation, and how might it level off in the back half of the year? 

### Answer

- Wynn has been disciplined in managing operating expenses, with Q1 OpEx per day well below Q1 2019 levels and only a 3% sequential increase. 
- The company will continue to be disciplined in OpEx management, considering the events calendar and revenue mix as key drivers of margins going forward. 

## Las Vegas Market and Consumer Behavior

### Question

- Have you observed any areas of skittishness or potential normalization in consumer behavior, particularly regarding potential leisure pushback at the high end? 

### Answer

- Wynn has not observed any areas of skittishness in Las Vegas. 
- The company believes that the current industry dynamics, including the deployment of capital by competitors and the overall market demand, support its pricing power and performance. 
- Booking windows have returned to normal, and the company is experiencing strong pace in group bookings and across all channels. 

## Las Vegas Property Occupancy and Rate Balancing

### Question

- Is there a structural reason why Las Vegas property occupancy couldn't go higher, considering the high rate and modest rate increases? 

### Answer

- Wynn aims to balance occupancy and rate to avoid walking guests due to room availability and to maintain a great on-property experience. 
- In Macau, the dynamics allow for higher occupancy due to in-market demand and the ability to offer rooms to individuals already present. 
- While Las Vegas occupancy could be pushed higher at times, the company prioritizes optimizing revenue while ensuring a positive guest experience. 

## Thailand Market Opportunity and Development

### Question

- Can you provide more details on the potential opportunity in Thailand, such as timing, project size, and the level of competition expected in the bidding process? 

### Answer

- It is early days for the Thailand market, and Wynn's further involvement is contingent on understanding the regulatory and licensing structure, which the company believes will be consistent with best-in-class jurisdictions. 
- The market is expected to be competitive, but Wynn is confident in its capabilities and is actively considering the opportunity. 

## Al Marjan Project Budget and Construction Progress

### Question

- Can you remind us of the total capital contribution and budget for the Al Marjan project, and if there have been any changes since the updated renderings were released? 

### Answer

- The total budget for the Al Marjan project is around $4 billion, with Wynn's capital contribution estimated at approximately $900 million, depending on construction leverage. 

## Las Vegas Property Performance by Month

### Question

- Can you provide more details on the performance of the Las Vegas property by month, specifically regarding January and March, and any additional color on the strong April results? 

### Answer

- February was the strongest month of the quarter, followed by March and January in rank order. 

## Al Marjan Project Regulatory Approval and Construction

### Question

- Are there any specific regulatory approvals required for the Al Marjan project beyond the standard licensing process, and can construction be completed before the casino can start operating? 

### Answer

- As with other jurisdictions, there are regulatory requirements that must be met before the casino can open. 
- Wynn expects to meet these requirements and receive the necessary approvals in due course. 
- The company is aware of the ongoing activities of the GCGRA and is aligned with the regulatory framework. 

## Macau Property Mass Hold Variability

### Question

- Do you anticipate more normalized variability in mass hold at the Wynn Macau property, given the current gaming volumes, or are there other factors at play? 

### Answer

- Hold has been high following the end of the quarter, but it is primarily a function of the normal ebb and flow of the game, particularly related to the volume of high-end play. 

## Las Vegas Development Opportunities and Considerations

### Question

- Under what circumstances would you consider developing the excess land in Las Vegas, and what factors would influence that decision? 

### Answer

- Wynn has a substantial land bank in Las Vegas but is currently prioritizing other development opportunities, including projects in the UAE, New York, and potentially Thailand. 
- The company is focused on its current development pipeline and future EBITDAR and free cash flow profile, but remains open to considering Las Vegas land development in the future.
