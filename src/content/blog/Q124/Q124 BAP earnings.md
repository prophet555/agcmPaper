# Question and Answer

## Yape's Contribution to Fee Income and Growth

### Question

- What is the potential impact of Yape on fee income, and what can be expected for fee growth in 2024? 

### Answer

- Yape's contribution to fee income is difficult to quantify due to its evolving business model and the J-curve effect on income generation. 
- The company's overall fee growth is driven by its "War on Cash" strategy, focusing on becoming the payment hub in Peru, and is expected to be in the low teens without the distortion from Bolivia. 

## Regulation and Potential Impacts

### Question

- Can you elaborate on the potential impacts of recent regulatory proposals in Congress, particularly those related to banking transfers, credit card payments, and pension reforms? 

### Answer

- Recent pension reform proposals have not been approved, and the company expresses concerns about the sustainability of the pension system without structural reforms. 
- Specific regulations on fees, including interbank fees, are uncertain in terms of approval timelines due to the rising populism in Congress. 

## Reconciling Growth and Cost of Risk Guidance

### Question

- How does the company plan to achieve its growth guidance while maintaining its cost of risk guidance, considering the current economic conditions and tight coverage ratio? 

### Answer

- The company expects gradual improvement in the economic outlook and cost of risk, particularly in the second half of the year, which will support loan growth. 
- Loan growth is expected to accelerate in the second quarter, benefiting from both economic factors and easier comparisons to the previous year. 

## Yape's Growth and Revenue Potential

### Question

- With Yape already reaching a significant portion of the adult population in Peru, how much more can its client base expand, and what is the potential for its revenue growth and revenue mix in the future? 

### Answer

- Yape's current focus is on increasing usage and monetization rather than adding new users, with a target of 300,000 new users per month. 
- The company expects Yape to diversify its revenue sources and explore new income streams beyond its current mature businesses, such as payments, lending, and marketplaces. 

## NIM Outlook and Margin Expansion

### Question

- Is there room for further net interest margin (NIM) expansion, considering the expected loan growth and declining interest rates? What is the sensitivity of margins to further rate decreases? 

### Answer

- The company anticipates maintaining current NIM levels, which are significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, and focuses on managing risk-adjusted NIM through portfolio duration and the shift towards a more retail-oriented loan portfolio. 

## Operating Expenses and Efficiency Ratio

### Question

- Given the company's performance relative to its efficiency ratio guidance, are there opportunities to improve efficiency further, particularly as new initiatives mature and technology investments pay off? What is the long-term goal for efficiency? 

### Answer

- The company acknowledges that without investments in new technologies, efficiency could improve, but it remains committed to its disruptive initiatives and expects them to be cash flow neutral by 2025. 
- While overall expenses have increased, the composition of expenses is shifting towards more efficient traditional businesses, while disruptive initiatives are gaining scale and relative weight. 
- The company acknowledges the potential for efficiency improvement as new initiatives mature and break even, but remains committed to investing in innovation. 

## Other Initiative Performance: Tenpo and EO

### Question

- Can you provide an update on the performance of other initiatives, such as Tenpo in Chile and EO in Peru? 

### Answer

- Tenpo is performing well and on track with its leading indicators, but it is not expected to break even in the short term. The company has filed for a full banking license in Chile. 
- EO is focusing on the mass affluent segment in Peru with a digital value proposition and is showing promising early results in terms of transaction levels and customer stickiness. 

## Dividends and Capitalization Levels

### Question

- What factors influenced the company's dividend distribution, and is there potential for further distribution throughout the year? 

### Answer

- The company considers the capitalization levels of its operating units, such as BCP and Mibanco, when determining dividends. 
- A growing first dividend is expected throughout the year, and further dividends may be evaluated based on performance and capital needs. 

## Yape's Multi-Installment Loans and Asset Quality

### Question

- Can you comment on the asset quality of Yape's multi-installment loans, including their size, target clients, and the development of risk models based on Yape data? 

### Answer

- Yape's multi-installment loans are in early stages, and the company is using data and pilot programs to enhance risk models, both with BCP data and Yape's data. 

## Excess Capital and FX Volatility

### Question

- Does the company have excess capital at the holding level, and can you clarify the impact of FX volatility on capital, particularly for loans in dollars? 

### Answer

- The company retains excess capital at the holding level and distributes the remaining profits to Credicorp. 
- The company maintains a structurally balanced book in its subsidiaries, minimizing the impact of FX volatility on capital.
