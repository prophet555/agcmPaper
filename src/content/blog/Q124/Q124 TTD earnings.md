### Answer

## Ad Category Mix and CTV Initiatives

### Question

- Why has the mix of ad categories across The Trade Desk's platform remained relatively unchanged, with video not seeing a significant increase despite CTV initiatives? 

### Answer

## Importance of a Unified Currency in CTV Advertising

### Question

- As the CTV advertising landscape becomes more complex, how important is it for advertisers to have a unified currency and automated processes to navigate the evolving market? 

### Answer

- The proliferation of CTV apps and ad inventory necessitates a data-driven and automated approach to advertising, with a focus on reaching target audiences and managing frequency across multiple platforms.
