# Question and Answer

### Answer

- The demand environment for net new sales was in line with expectations, with the company's value proposition and strategy continuing to resonate. 
- Channel contribution remained strong, with new business coming from the channel exceeding 25%. 
- Top of funnel activity and talent acquisition for the go-to-market team were as expected. 

## Sales Force Expansion and Productivity

### Question

- Given the current growth rate, how will the company approach hiring and expanding the sales force for the rest of the year? 

### Answer

- The company will focus on driving productivity improvements in the sales force rather than hiring at the same rate as the previous year. 
- The exact percentage of hiring for the next year will be provided in the next earnings call, but the emphasis will be on balancing growth with profitability targets. 

## Back-to-Base Motion and Sales Efforts

### Question

- Does now potentially feel like the right time to focus more on the back-to-base motion and sales efforts? 

### Answer

- The company has made improvements in its ability to go back to the base, and that opportunity is still ahead. 
- The focus will be on gradually adding products, ensuring client adoption, and maintaining a scalable approach to gradually increasing the back-to-base sales efforts. 

## Share Repurchase Authorization

### Question

- Why is the company implementing a $500 million share repurchase authorization at this time, and is there any update on the potential M&A strategy? 

### Answer

- There is no update on the M&A strategy, which remains focused on product-oriented or technology-oriented deals. 
- The timing of the share repurchase is due to the company's strong cash position, free cash flow progress, and low trading multiples, which present an opportunity to drive shareholder value through buybacks. 
- The buyback also helps offset stock-based compensation dilution. 

## Long-Term Growth Target and Profitability

### Question

- Can you clarify the long-term outlook and the 20% long-term growth target? Is it still comparable to the previous $2 billion target? 

### Answer

- The current growth rate is below the 20% target, and the company recognizes that 20% growth may not be the right target at this time. 
- The focus remains on growth as the top priority, but with an increased emphasis on profitability targets. 
- Setting a $2 billion milestone seems to be a more appropriate way to focus on growth rather than the 20% target. 

## Replacement of Cloud Solutions and Competitive Landscape

### Question

- Are you starting to see more replacements of other cloud solutions in the pipeline or deals won? 

### Answer

- The competitive landscape is a function of the company's and other cloud competitors' growth, with a relatively low market share leading to most sales being replacements for existing methods. 
- As the company and other cloud players grow, they start to encounter each other more frequently in deals, but the take rate between competitors is still relatively low. 

## Fourth Quarter Guidance and Fiscal 2025 Expectations

### Question

- Are there any hints you can provide about factors that could impact growth in fiscal 2025, and how is the company thinking about the long-term growth outlook?

- Initiatives around productivity, innovation, and the share repurchase authorization have been successful. 
- The company is taking into consideration factors such as elongated sales cycles with larger clients and the macroeconomic environment when setting expectations for fiscal 2025. 

## Talent Solutions and Go-to-Market Strategy

### Question

- Can you provide more details about the talent solutions you're rolling out and how they will impact the go-to-market motion, including back-to-base, upselling, and cross-selling? 

### Answer

- Features like community and collaboration tools are available to all clients and contribute to the company's differentiation as the most modern platform in the industry. 
- The company will continue to add additional modules and features based on client feedback and market needs to drive strong win rates across all customer segments. 

## AI in HR and Sales Cycle Dynamics

### Question

- Can you discuss the role of AI in HR and whether it presents an opportunity or hindrance in the current environment? 

### Answer

- AI presents many opportunities in HR, and the company has embedded AI capabilities across its product suite, including personalization, recommendations, writing assistance, and forecasting models. 
- The company is also investing in AI to improve the serviceability of its products and assist customers in navigating the various modules they purchase. 
- While elongated sales cycles have been observed, the company attributes this more to macroeconomic uncertainty and initiatives are in place to address these challenges. 

## Linearity of Demand and Fourth Quarter Guidance

### Question

- Was there consistent demand linearity throughout the quarter, and did you observe any incremental pressure towards the end that informed the deceleration in Q4 guidance? 

### Answer

- Bookings exhibit natural seasonality, with clients typically starting at the beginning of each quarter, resulting in larger start months like January.

## Fourth Quarter Guidance - Rate Cut Assumptions and Gross Margin

### Question

### Answer

- The Q4 guidance no longer assumes a rate cut, which was previously included in the February guidance. 
- Gross margin can vary quarter-to-quarter, and while it was relatively flat year-over-year in the third quarter, the company expects to drive leverage over the long term across the entire P&L. 
- Significant leverage has been achieved in G&A, and the company is confident in its ability to continue delivering strong financial performance and returning value to shareholders.

### Question

- How is the company's focus on being a modern platform resonating with Gen Z customers, and is this a trend that others are also pursuing? 

### Answer

### Question

- Can you clarify whether there were any one-time or unexpected sources of form filing revenue in Q3 that need to be considered when looking at Q3 growth rates for next year?
