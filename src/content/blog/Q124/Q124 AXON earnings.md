# Question and Answer

## Draft One Approval Process and Adoption

### Question

- How long do you foresee departments needing for approval processes for Draft One, and will the approval processes speed up once major departments sign off? 

### Answer

- Draft One has generated significant enthusiasm, with many police officers finding the reports it generates to be superior to those they write themselves. 
- The adoption process is expected to be relatively frictionless, with low barriers to entry and positive feedback from early users. 
- While there will be a sales cycle associated with the product, early orders are coming in, and the pipeline is building, indicating that it will contribute to in-quarter revenue in the second half of the year and beyond. 

## Fusus and Dedrone Contribution to the Year

### Question

- What is the expected contribution of Fusus and Dedrone to the year, both inorganic growth-wise and in terms of their impact on the company's financials? 

### Answer

- Fusus and Dedrone are small and growing quickly, but their contribution to the top line and overall growth rate is immaterial. 
- The company is cautious about EBITDA due to absorbing the integration costs of these acquisitions and ensuring a successful integration. 
- The company's guidance accounts for these impacts, and it is not expected to pull the Q1 EBITDA margin through to the rest of the year. 

## Q1 Revenue Growth and Full-Year Guidance

### Question

- The strong mid-30s percent revenue growth in Q1 implies some deceleration for the full year based on the raised guidance. Can you provide perspective on whether this is due to pull-forward into Q1 or conservatism for the remainder of the year? 

### Answer

- The company prefers to see more of the year materialize before providing a full-year revenue estimate. 
- Q1 typically has the slowest revenue quarter, making the year-over-year comparison easier. 
- The company is optimistic about having another great year and will update guidance quarterly as necessary. 
- The deceleration in the full-year guidance is primarily due to lapping a very strong previous year. 

## TASER Automation and Gross Margin

### Question

- Can you provide an update on the TASER automation process, the availability of supply to meet demand, and any impact on gross margins? 

### Answer

- The company is balancing ramping up capacity and working on cost-down initiatives for TASER 10. 
- Demand for TASER 10 has been better than expected, and the company is focusing on ramping capacity to support this demand. 
- While it may take some time to implement cost-down initiatives, the company is on track with its plans. 
- Gross margins for the rest of the year may be impacted by a general mix shift, with devices expected to be lighter and software stronger compared to Q1. 
- The company does not expect gross margins to improve for the full year compared to Q1. 

## Seasonality of Bookings

### Question

- Can you discuss the seasonality of bookings and the factors contributing to the sequential decline in Q1, which is unusual for the company? 

### Answer

- Q1 is typically the low point for bookings due to several factors, including coming off a strong Q4, adding salespeople and adjusting to new regions, and the lack of urgency from customers with no major fiscal budgets ending in Q1. 
- Q1 is focused on building the foundation and rebuilding the pipeline, and the company expects a strong response from the sales team in quarters 2, 3, and 4. 

## Federal Business and Deployment Schedule

### Question

- Are the large federal bookings from last year starting to deploy, or is there a longer deployment schedule? How will this contribute to overall revenue growth? 

### Answer

- Many large federal bookings are phased into multiple years, and revenue is recognized upon product deployment or shipment for TASER. 
- While there may be some noise in the timing of shipments and deployments, the company is confident in the healthy pipeline for the federal business and expects another strong year. 

## Body Cam Safety and Engineering

### Question

- In light of a recent body cam issue with a competitor's solution catching fire, can you discuss how quickly Axon could provide a replacement product if asked and what engineering measures have been taken to ensure the safety of Axon's cameras from battery malfunctions? 

### Answer

- The company expresses concern for the injured captain and is focused on continuing to build great products. 
- Axon has invested significantly in its hardware and devices pillar and has considered and addressed potential edge cases and safety concerns. 
- While specifics of the engineering are not disclosed, the company is confident in the performance of its products and will be ready to deploy if an opportunity arises. 

## TASER 10 Demand and Automation

### Question

- Is there anything to highlight regarding the strength of TASER 10 demand in Q1, particularly between domestic and international markets, and the timing of automation benefits? 

### Answer

- TASER 10 is experiencing exceptional demand, outpacing TASER 7 by double and showing strong indicators of effectiveness in outperforming firearms. 
- The company is working to ramp up production capacity to meet this demand and is investing in automation to maximize build capacity. 
- The future looks bright for TASER 10, and the company expects it to be a significant driver of growth. 

## Dedrone Acquisition and Market Potential

### Question

- The Dedrone acquisition significantly expands your TAM, but it may face sensitivity and potential pushback due to concerns about how it will be used. Can you discuss how you expect Dedrone to be deployed, its potential for becoming a material contributor in the future, and the timeline for this? 

### Answer

- Dedrone is focused on monitoring drones in the airspace, particularly in response to the new threat vector that drones pose in modern warfare and their potential use in various public safety risks. 
- The company does not anticipate significant pushback as Dedrone primarily addresses the need to protect against aerial threats and provides transparency and control over drone usage, including by government agencies. 
- Dedrone is expected to be a significant pillar of the company's business in the future, with a focus on long-term growth and investments in robotic security. 

## Competitive Landscape for Draft 1

### Question

- Given the incredible demand for Draft 1, how challenging do you see the competitive landscape for entering this market, considering the presence of other solutions, and what advantages does Axon's ecosystem provide? 

### Answer

- The company acknowledges the competitive market but believes its ecosystem, customer trust, and rigorous evaluation of risks provide a strong competitive advantage. 
- Draft 1 focuses on responsible AI usage and high payback, minimal risk applications, which contribute to its positive reception and early excitement from customers. 

## Data and AI Concerns for Fusus

### Question

- With the increasing importance of data for AI, are there any concerns about data sharing for products like Fusus, which rely on data from various sources, including non-Axon proprietary data, and the potential for vendors to become less cooperative in sharing data? 

### Answer

- The company has not encountered any pushback regarding data sharing for Fusus, as most partners share data with the primary goal of enhancing safety and supporting law enforcement. 
- Customers have the ultimate control over data sharing and can choose to work with multiple vendors and partners, which incentivizes all parties to collaborate effectively and maintain good relationships. 

## Counter UAS Use Cases for Dedrone

### Question

- How much do you intend to focus on counter UAS use cases for Dedrone, and what opportunities does this present for expanding the customer base and leveraging the Axon ecosystem? 

### Answer

- The company plans to lean into counter UAS use cases to protect lives from drone-related threats. 
- Dedrone is expected to be appealing to new customer segments, such as major sporting stadiums, critical infrastructure, and military organizations, both in the U.S. and internationally. 

## Bone Acquisition Rationale and Technology Stack Participation

### Question

- Why is now the right time to acquire Bone, and has there been any change in your thoughts regarding the technology stack you want to participate in for the drone opportunity compared to your approach with TASER and body cams? 

### Answer

- The company's decision to acquire Bone was driven by the strategic importance of robotic security and the opportunity to strengthen its roadmap and pillars through M&A. 
- The company's approach to the technology stack, whether to build, partner, or acquire, is an evolving target and is based on evaluating the best combinations for achieving its goals and maximizing leverage. 

## CapEx Rationale and Timing for Investments

### Question

- Can you explain the rationale behind accelerating investment plans this early in the year, and should we expect a gradual increase in automation and capacity, or will there be a more significant inflection point in a later quarter? 

### Answer

- The decision to accelerate investments is driven by the best pipeline the company has ever had coming out of Q1 and the need to meet the strong demand for TASER 10. 
- Investments in capacity involve buying specialized equipment with lead times, requiring early action to support capacity increases in 2025. 
- The company is steadily ramping up capacity to avoid backlog issues and is confident in the demand and pipeline, making it prudent to bring capacity online now rather than waiting. 

## Axon Cloud Services Growth and Drivers

### Question

- Can you provide insights into the sequential growth expectations for Axon Cloud Services and the key drivers behind this growth? 

### Answer

- The significant step-up in Q4 was partially due to revenue recognition and the lumpy nature of records revenue. 
- The $13 million step-up in Q1 is still healthy and in line with the company's expectations for normal quarterly growth. 

## Themes Across Recent Axon Wins

### Question

- Can you discuss the progress of RCMP field testing and any common themes observed across recent Axon wins, such as those in Cornelius, North Carolina, or Puerto Rico, particularly in terms of product or cost advantages? 

### Answer
