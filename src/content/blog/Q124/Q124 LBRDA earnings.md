# Question and Answer

## ACP Extension Act for Charter

### Question

- Is there any hope for a last-minute extension of the ACP? 

### Answer

- While there is some bipartisan support for extending the ACP, procedural issues may impede its passage. 

## Deleveraging Strategy for Liberty Broadband

### Question

- Given current interest rates and credit market conditions, is deleveraging a better strategy for increasing equity value than stock buybacks for Liberty Broadband? 

### Answer

- Both Liberty Broadband and Charter plan to use cash flow for buybacks to reduce debt levels. 
- This strategy demonstrates responsiveness to market conditions and the higher cost of interest. 

## Charter's Footprint Expansion and Share Repurchases

### Question

- Should Charter consider slowing down its footprint expansion to free up cash for larger share repurchases, considering its discounted EBITDA valuation? 

### Answer

- Charter is being more thoughtful about expansion opportunities and balancing them with the market's preference for free cash flow. 
- The company does not anticipate significant declines in ARPU following potential ACP losses. 

## Investment in Mobile Growth for Cable Companies

### Question

- Is there an opportunity for cable companies, particularly Charter, to invest more in mobile to accelerate its growth and become a dominant mobile provider? 

### Answer

- Charter has been aggressive in pursuing mobile and is already the most active among cable companies in this space. 
- The company is likely maximizing its current efforts in mobile, and given the current environment with reduced store activity, further acceleration may be limited. 
- However, Charter remains bullish on future mobile growth and gaining market share. 

## Liberty Broadband's Potential for Cable Company Roll-Ups

### Question

- With depressed valuations for cable assets, is there an opportunity for Liberty Broadband to consider rolling up other cable companies? 

### Answer

- While the door is not closed on this possibility, in most cases, it would be more advantageous to pursue such opportunities through Charter due to the synergies it offers. 
- There may be exceptions where a direct acquisition makes sense for Liberty Broadband. 

## Factors Driving NAV Discount and Strategies to Address It

### Question

### Answer

- Factors include a lack of comparable peers, fewer funds arbitraging the opportunity, and higher borrowing costs.
