### Answer

- The company is seeing increased adoption of Avigilon Alta and cloud services, which is estimated to be a $40 million headwind for full-year growth but had a positive impact on Q1 performance.

## LMR Growth and Cycle

### Question

- Can you provide insights into the LMR product and services growth and where the company is in the cycle, particularly with APX NEXT and device refresh? 

### Answer

- The company is extremely pleased with the performance of LMR products and services, with continued strong demand and above-expectations growth rates. 
- The growth is driven by the entire APX segment, including APX NEXT, APX Originals, TETRA, and PCR, with device refresh and adoption of feature-rich devices contributing to revenue and margin expansion. 
- The company is still in the middle of the game on device refresh, with a lot more potential for growth.

## Managed Services Customer Relationships

### Question

- Is there any evidence of other managed services customers attempting to reprice contracts with the company in other parts of the world?

## Business Impact of Ukraine Situation

### Question

- Has the recent aid package and developments in Ukraine changed the company's view on the $100 million headwind previously mentioned? 

### Answer

- The company's view on the full-year guidance and the $100 million headwind from Ukraine remains unchanged. 
- The headwind is primarily expected in the second half of the year, which informs the seasonality implied in the Q2 and full-year guidance. 
- The company is actively engaged on multiple fronts related to the Ukraine situation and is pleased with the Foreign Aid Bill but maintains its guidance. 

## Command Center Growth and ESN Impact

### Question

- Has the company's outlook on the contribution of the Command Center business to growth this year changed? 

### Answer

- The company remains enthusiastic about the Command Center business and still expects 10% growth for the full year. 
- Q1 Command Center growth would have been in handsome double digits if normalized for the U.K. Home Office impact, and the full-year guidance implies even higher growth when normalized for ESN.

## Product Segment Margins and Future Outlook

### Question

- Can you elaborate on the drivers behind the strong margins in the Product segment, the remaining benefit from pricing and supply chain improvements, and the outlook for 2024 and beyond? 

### Answer

- The $60 million benefit from lower broker costs (PPV) is a full-year number, with more to come in future quarters. 
- The company is experiencing the need to use far fewer brokers, and supply chain improvements from direct vendors are helping obtain parts at the right prices, contributing to margin improvements. 
- The company expects gross margins to be up slightly and operating margins to be up about 75 basis points in 2024, driven by volume mix, surgical price increases, refresh of the device portfolio, and ongoing OpEx discipline. 
- The company is committed to driving operating margin improvement through disciplined use of AI in product analytics and customer service, while maintaining a focus on growth and taking market share. 

## Backlog Trends and Airwave Impact

### Question

- Can you provide more insights into the backlog trends, particularly when excluding the impact of Airwave, and how to interpret the sequential decline in backlog? 

### Answer

- Excluding the impact of the U.K. Home Office on a multi-quarter basis, total backlog is up over $500 million, and S&S backlog is up over $600 million. 
- The sequential decline in backlog is partially due to the $748 million related to the Airwave extension and a reduction in backlog from pricing controls for years '24, '25, and '26, but the core business at the Home Office is growing.
