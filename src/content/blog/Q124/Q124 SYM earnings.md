## BreakPack Revenue Contribution and Non-Ambient Market

### Question

- Do you expect BreakPack to contribute to revenue in fiscal 2024, and when will Symbotic target the non-ambient market? 

### Answer

- BreakPack may contribute to revenue towards the end of 2024 due to the selling cycle, while the non-ambient market is being piloted with perishable testing in a perishable warehouse. 
- The company expects to offer perishables in approximately 12 months and frozen items in the future. 

## System Starts and Operational Stabilization

### Question

- Can you explain the decision to temporarily stabilize the number of system starts and how it aligns with operational management and outsourcing partnerships? 

### Answer

- Stabilizing the number of system starts does not imply a lack of growth but rather a focus on delivering on the existing backlog and ramping up the number of operational systems. 
- The company will continue to improve the number of systems deployed each quarter, with a focus on delivering systems from the current backlog and adding one to two new customers per year. 

## EBITDA Guidance and Customer Support

### Question

- What does the EBITDA guidance assumption of flexibility in deploying resources to support customers entail, and is this related to difficulties with recent projects or supporting newer customers? 

### Answer

- The flexibility in deploying resources is necessary due to the current scaling phase, with 37 projects in deployment compared to 22 a year ago. 
- The company is focused on adhering to schedules and delivering high-quality systems, even if it requires additional resources or slightly longer timelines. 
- The company prioritizes long-term customer satisfaction and quality system delivery over short-term margin optimization. 

## R&D Expenses and Long-Term Deployment Goals

### Question

- Why have R&D expenses declined in recent quarters, and what is the outlook for R&D spending? What are the long-term goals for deployment timelines? 

### Answer

- The decline in R&D expenses from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is due to the extra week in the previous year's fourth quarter. 
- R&D expenses are expected to grow modestly throughout the year, with a focus on innovation projects and efficiency improvements. 
- The long-term goal for deployment timelines is to reduce the 20-month cycle to 12 months or lower. 

## Growth Investment and OpEx Trends

## Non-Ambient Food Opportunity and Walmart Backlog

### Question

- Can you provide any insights into the size of the non-ambient food opportunity with existing customers and whether the Walmart backlog includes revenue for non-ambient systems? 

### Answer

- The Walmart backlog does not include non-ambient systems, and the non-ambient food market is a significant opportunity due to the need for increased system capabilities and smaller system footprints. 
- The company is focused on increasing system density and reducing the number of bots required, which could lead to both margin improvement and the ability to offer systems at lower price points. 

## BreakPack Use Cases and Deployment Timeline

### Question

- How important is it to secure a use case for BreakPack outside of large customers like Walmart, and how does this impact the market expansion strategy?
