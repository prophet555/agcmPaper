### Answer

- The EMEA margin reflects a combination of factors, including price management, cost control, and managing the spread between the two. 
- The company's use of AI in power management and other cost optimization efforts have contributed to the sustained margin improvement. 
- Linde's pricing strategy focuses on product pricing rather than surcharges, ensuring sustainable pricing actions and product differentiation. 

## Volume Growth and Helium Business

### Question

- What is the contribution of new projects to volume growth, and how does the helium business impact overall margins? 

### Answer

- New projects contribute approximately 1% to volume growth, with base volumes down around 2% reflecting the global industrial production trend. 
- The helium business is a very small, low single-digit part of sales and does not have a significant impact on overall margins. 

## CapEx and Productivity Initiatives

### Question

- Why is CapEx being reduced despite the lack of volume growth, and how are productivity initiatives being adjusted? 

### Answer

- CapEx reduction is driven by optimization efforts in both the backlog and base CapEx, aligning with the current weak industrial activity. 
- The company remains open to increasing CapEx for high-quality growth projects, including small on-site and applications development. 
- Productivity initiatives in both Americas and EMEA continue to focus on cost management and project execution, with a track record of success in driving benefits. 

## Americas Performance and Aerospace Industry

### Question

- Can you quantify the impact of volume walkaways and one-time issues in the Americas, particularly in the manufacturing and healthcare segments? 

### Answer

- The decline in manufacturing volumes is partly attributed to the rationalization of the hard goods equipment portfolio.
